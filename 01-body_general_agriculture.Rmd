- Support in national economy

- 10th five year plan focused on emphasized agriculture based commerce and industries, cooperative farming, cooperative based agriculture input supply, and cooperative based small farmer irrigation project implementation, dairy collection and supply and other cooperative based approach to community development.
- The plan promoted active participation of cooperative groups and private sectors for the efforts.
- National agriculture policy, 2061 has prioritized cooperative based agriculture industries and commerce promotion, farmer group cooperative formation and agriculture wholesale market and haat bazzar established and management via cooperatives.
- To legalize a cooperative organization establishment, it should be registered:
  - Under Organization act in District Administration Office, or
  - According to Cooperative act and regulations under Cooperative Division Office.

## Food security

For a more fundamental discussion of food security topic, refer to [lecture handout](https://github.com/DeependraD/life_science_presentations/raw/master/food_security.pdf), in link to life science presentations.

FAO defined food security in 1996 A.D. In 1996, convention held in Rome approved seven points of food soverignty. Nepal has been a member of FAO since 2007 BS (1950 AD).

McMichael's projection:

- 2 billion people suffer hidden hunger
- 1.5 billion people suffer over nutrition related problems

Since 1981 (2038 BS), FAO started celebrating World Food Day on October 16th. In Nepal, 34th World Food Day was celebrated in 2014 with the slogan: "Feeding the world, caring for the earth".

According to FAO's projection, 52% of the population in South Asia are dependent on Agriculture while agriculture contributes 22% to the total GDP in the region.

Pillars of food security:

1. Food availability
2. Food access
  - Nepal's poverty rate in 2001/2002 AD: 30%
  - Nepal's poverty rate in 2010 AD: 26%
  - Nepal's poverty rate at the end of 12th plan: 23.8%
3. Food utilization
  - Per person per day recommendation by WHO: 250 ml milk (91 ltr per year)
  - Nepal's aim for per day milk consumption: 156 ml (57 ltr per year)
  - Nepal's aim for per year meat consumption: 14 kg
  - Nepal's aim for per year egg consumption: 48
  - 30% of total daily protein requirement should be met by animal sources.
4. Food stability
  
- In 2011 AD, Nepal ranked 157th among 187 nations in HDI
- In 2014 AD, Nepal ranked 145th in HDI
- Poverty rate at village/rural areas: 27% (Survey, 2012)
- Poverty rate at cities: 15% (Survey, 2012)
- Monthly poverty:
  - Maximum at Chaitra-Baisakh
  - Minimum at Mangsir-Poush
  
State of food security in Nepal:

- Untill 2042 BS (1985), production was twice that satisfied the population's need.
- Upto 2047 BS, food insufficieny was absent.
- Currently 40 districts are declared food minimum and more than 27 districts of high hill and mountain districts are food insecure (when ??).
- Calorie deficiency is prevalent in 41% of population.
- In 19 districts of Midwestern Development Region and Eastern Development Region, food security project is launched.
- 46% of the total cultivated area is under rice.
- Of the total food production, contribution of respective crops are:
  - Rice: 56%
  - Maize: 24%
  - Wheat: 17%
  - Millet: 3.6%
  - Barley: 0.29%

One worrying aspect related to poverty is malnutrition. Indicators of malnutrition, particularly of children are still high not only in traditionally food deficit areas but increasingly also in food surplus areas. About 42% of children less than 5 years old suffer from stunting (NLSS 2010/11).

Three and half million people in Nepal, 13% of the population, are considered to be moderately to severely food insecure, and 42 out of 75 districts are classified as food insecure with respect to food grains (Draft Food and Nutrition Security Plan, MOAD, 2012).

The national cereal balance witnessed surplus of about 886,000 tons (equivalent to over 17% of total requirement) in 2011/12 ?? but in the past decade Nepal's average food grain import was about 5% of domestic production annually. Despite surplus, about 1.8 million people received staple food supplements from government.

## Agricultural Perspective Plan

- Finalized: 1995 with technical assistance of ADB
- Implemented for the period: 2052/53 -- 2071/72 BS

The Agricultural Perspective Plan (APP) was designed to increase agricultural growth whereby per capita AGDP will grow from its 1995 level of 0.5% to 4% per year. This growth was expected to stimulate nonagricultural growth in employment-intensive goods and services in both urban and rural areas. This would open up job opportunities for the poor, particularly poor women, and thereby help reduce the number of rural poor. With implementation of the APP the incidence of poverty was expected to come down from 42% in 1991/92 to 14% in 2014/15, whereas the latter figure without the APP would have been 29%. Poverty in 2011 is estimated at 25%, which is still far from the APP target. The increase in agricultural productivity was also expected to help protect the environment by removing the most fragile land resources from agriculture and putting them under suitable forest cover and other sustainable uses.

The overall objectives of APP were as follows:

1. Accelerate the growth rate in agriculture through increased factor productivity;

2. Alleviate poverty and achieve significant improvement in the standard of living through accelerated growth and expanded employment opportunities;

3. transform agriculture from subsistence to commercial orientation through diversification and realization of comparative advantage; 

4. Expand opportunities for overall economic transformation by fulfilling the preconditions of agricultural development; 

5. Identify immediate, short-term and long-term strategies for implementation, and provide clear guidelines for preparing future periodic plans and programs.

The APP strategy is to accelerate the agricultural growth rate sufficiently to obtain strong multiplier effects on growth and employment, in both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. This growth would occur through technological change to be achieved through investment in research and extension. The APP aims for a broad-based participatory growth across regions and income classes and emphasizes sub-sectors particularly important to women.

The following six strategic thrusts are identified as essential to achieve APP objectives: 

1. A technology-based green revolution in agriculture which becomes the initial engine of accelerated growth;
2. Accelerated agricultural growth which creates a demand-pull for the production of high-value commodities in agriculture, as well as for non-agricultural commodities, with consequent large multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy;
3. Broadly based high employment growth, which then becomes the mechanism for achieving societal objectives;
4. Public policy and investment focus on a small number of priorities, building on past investment in human capital and physical and institutional infrastructure;
5. A package approach to development, which would be different for the Terai, Hills and Mountains and would recognize the powerful complementation between public and private investment and priorities, and would ensure their co-ordination;
6. A regionally balanced and gender-balanced approach that explicitly ensures the participation of women and therefore achieves broad participation.

Targets

1. Increase country's agricultural growth by 2% (3% -- 5%)
2. Reduce poverty povery from 49% to 14%
3. Increase per person agriculture income from 0.5% to 3% (6 folds)
4. Increase contribution of livestock farming from 31% to 45%
5. Increase in livestock products growth rate from 2.3 to 6.2%
6. Contribution of agriculture in GDP was expected to decrease from 41.7% to 25%.
7. HVC production rate increase from 4.8% to 5.8%
8. Full unemployment decrease from 4.7% to 3% and half unemployment decrease to 10% from 47%.
9. Crop growth rate increase from 3.17% to 3.71%.
10. Horticulture production increase from 4.84% to 5.8%.
11. Fruit production increment per year from 5.13% to 6.29%.
12. Vegetable production increment from 4.63% to 5.4%.

- Number of people below poverty line will be reduced from 9.8 million to 3.8 million.

### Progress summary

APP design gave priority to certain key inputs (i.e., irrigation, fertilizer, technology, roads and power, and financial credit for agriculture), and key outputs (i.e. livestock, high value crops, agribusiness and forestry). Agricultural sector growth has been less than the APP target of 4 % annual AGDP growth, achieving an average of 3.0 %, slightly below the national GDP average growth of 3.5% in the past decade and rising only after 2010 (National Accounts Estimates, Nepal, 2012). 

The agricultural sector in Nepal has made progress in several indicators of well-being and development. For example, income per capita and productivity of agricultural labor has increased, poverty has reduced, and malnutrition has declined. The road network has considerably expanded and irrigation cover has increased as well. In almost all agriculture subsectors (crop, livestock, fishery, and agroforestry) there has been progress in terms of production or/and productivity. However, the sector is in a low development stage as highlighted by a number of indicators including labor productivity, productivity gaps, trade and competitiveness, poverty and malnutrition, and infrastructure. There are however positive signals that show not only the potential for growth but also opportunities that the ADS should build upon.

Growth of agricultural GDP since the beginning of the APP (1995/96) has been slow (about 3%), highly variable from year to year, and with a slight upward trend due to stronger growth in 2011 and 2012. With a growth of population of around 2 percent over the same period, the increase in agricultural GDP per capita has been too slow to create strong dynamics leading to sustained poverty reduction and structural transformation from subsistence to commercialization.

Over the period of APP, agriculture sector (and overal economy, in general) has seen slow growth when compared to neighboring countries, most of which had considerably faster GDP growth then Nepal. 

Agriculture absorbs the majority of the labor force (61% self-employed in agriculture, 3% earning wages from agriculture) (NLSSIII, 2010/11). But this labor force is characterized by low productivity relatively to the rest of the economy. The estimate of labor productivity in agriculture in Nepal ($794/unit of agricultural labor) is about one fourth of the productivity in the rest of the economy. The weak performance of agriculture has created strong incentives for a large part of the most productive labor force (the ones in 20-40 age group) to seek employment abroad. The departure of migrants reached the level of almost 300000 in 2010.

Agricultural land per capital also decreased as the combined effect of several factors including inheritances, loss of agricultural land to urbanization, and degradation of land. Smaller size and more fragmented farms make it more difficult to realize economics of scale and also to provide sufficient livelihood for smallholder farm families. Even though GDP per hectare of cultivated land is about \$1800, the average farm size is only about 0.7 ha per household on average and more than 50% of households have farm size less than 0.5 ha. Although, it should be noted that, aggregate land productivity does not compare too badly with several neighbors of Nepal. During 2011 Nepal had 0.082 ha arable land per capita which yielded 2481 kg of cereal per hectare and fetched ADGP equivalent of \$2651 per hectare (India had \$2139 per hectare).

Among several factors reported to contribute towards low productivity, low adoption of improved agricultural technology remains a key one. The productivity gap between current and potential production is significant and this related to high level of farming for subsistence, access and adoption of suitable technology (both on farm and post-harvest), availability of inputs (planting material, breeds, feed, plant and animal health protection, irrigation, electricity, finance), and limited investment in the sector. Nepal has an estimated 44.7% of agricultural entities commercialized and 55.3% under subsistence farming entities. Staple commodities such as rice, wheat, potato and vegetables have higher commercialization rates (30-50%) than maize and fruits (15-25%).

Huge productivity gaps are noticed in several subsectors of agriculture including fish (Current production: 3.6 t/ha/year, Potential production: 10 t/ha/year), timber (CP: 0.337 cum/year, PP: 13.4 cum/year), paddy (CP: 2.72 t/ha/year, PP: 10-12 t/ha/year).

One set of constraints to the realization of such potential is the availability of inputs. For example feed ingredient supply is the major input to poultry and 60% is imported at relatively high cost.

The use of chemical NPK fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) in Nepal 2011/12 was 422,547 MT of which only about 25% is imported and officially declared to customs. This amount is sold on a subsidized rate by the state only through agricultural cooperatives. However, price does not substantially affect farmers' demand, and the other 75% is imported informally.

SRR has remained very low. Against the desirable SRR for crops at 25% to 30%, average SRR is only 4% to 8% for wheat followed by 4.4% in rice, 3.8% in maize and 1.6% for pulses.

Nepal's agricultural trade is in deficit. The growth of imports has outpaced exports and the agricultural trade deficit has increased over the years from \$124 million to \$373 million (TEPC, 2009/10). Nepal imports primary and industrial raw materials (due to declining domestic raw material production), and processed agriculture products (due to limited investment and competitiveness in high-quality, high-value agro-processing). The range of exports is concentrated in a narrow set of manufactured and agricultural products, such as carpets, ready-made garments, pashmina, handicrafts, lentils, tea, cardamom, fruit, ginger, vegetable ghee and medicinal and aromatic plant products (MAPs).

Nepal's agricultural import and export trade comprises about 15.6% of total trade, which includes items such as petroleum, construction materials, vehicles and equipment, consumer goods and others. Export value of the top three high value crops exceeds the value of cereal and diary imports.

Nepal has comparative advantages in export markets in resource- and labor-intensive low technology agriculture products such as dried vegetables, coffee, tea, vegetable and roots, ginger, and cardamom.

The Industrial Policy, 2010 has prioritized agriculture and agro-forestry industries for investment, and provides additional incentives and facilities to these industries. Foreign investment in agriculture sector (including processing and retailing) is less than 1% of total foreign investment.

The overall performance of APP has been mixed. The implementation of the APP was not helped by the conflict that plagued the country during approximately the first 10 years of the APP period. In addition to the reduced government and donors' support there are other factors that contributed to the weak performance of the APP including:

- Lack of Coordination
- Withdrawal of Subsidies on Fertilizer and Tube Wells (shallow and deep tube wells)
- Faults in the Design and Economic Assumptions of the APP
- Weak institutional capacity on project/program implementation
- Lack of Attention to Legal Issues
- Lack of Attention to Social and Geographic Inclusiveness
- Low Attention to Land Management Issues
- Inadequate Consideration of Regional Trade

Broadly, the explanation of the slow progress is based on eight sets of interrelated factors: Implementation, legal aspects, design aspects (rigid targets, simplistic view of technology, narrow green revolution perspective, emphasis on guiding inputs and outputs, lack of systems for re-planning), conflict, politics and policies, investment, capacity and human resources, and plans.

## Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS)

- Was developed by MoAD with support from technical assistance of ADB, Rastriya Kishan Sanjal (National peasants' coalition) comprising a technical team of 12 other development co-partners in preparation (IFAD, EU, FAO, SDC, JICA, AUSAID, DANIDA, WFP, DFID, USAID, WB, UN women).
- The ADS report includes a 10-year Action Plan and Roadmap and a rationale based on the assessment of the current and past performance of the agriculture sector.
- Key issues for the ADS: Productivity; competitiveness; trade; commercialization; infrastructure; credit, insurance and taxes; subsidies; land; food and nutrition security; institutions and human resources; climate change and natural resource management; social and geographic inclusion; and legal.

- Vision (7 sub heads):
  - Self reliance
  - Sustainability
  - Competition
  - Inclusive
  - Economic growth
  - Improved livelihood
  - Food and nutrition security

- There are 16 indicators and corresponding targets for ADS vision (last 4 indicator labels in table below \ref{tab:ads-indicator-targets} are grouped under single indicator).

## Department of Food Technology and Quality Control

Department of Food Technology and Quality Control (DFTQC) is one of the three departments under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestocks Development of Government of Nepal. It was established in 1961 AD as Department of Food and placed in Singha Durbar, which later in 1965 was shifted to present location of Babarmahal, Kathmandu. In 1966, the Department of Food then was renamed as Food Research Laboratory. The laboratory later in 1980 was again converted to Central Food Research Laboratory (CFRL) and known by this name until it became the present department in 2000 under MoAD.

DFTQC played a pioneer role to lay down foundation stone for food quality control system, research and development in the field of food science and technology and nutrition support program.

### Kishan call center

The public agricultural extension service is able to reach only so far to 15% of the total farm households. While the need for professionalizing agriculture sector and improving livelihood standards of farming community is imminent. The issue of food security, besides being a hot topic of discussion in national and internatioal communitity, is closely associated with the citizen's rights. In this regard, it becomes all the more essential for traditional agricultural systems to be transformed to a information-technology based commercial system wherein farmers can connect with greater ease to subject specialists for consultation. For serving the purpose of addressing farmers' inquiries about crop and livestock, mainly concerning problems such as disease and pests, Kishan Call Center was established in 2072/73.

**Objectives**

- Addressing problems relating to crop, livestock and business enterprise faced by farmers and entrepreneurs through telephone contact with subject matter specialists.
- Minimize the geophysical barriers in communication and information exchange so that service delivery could be streamlined.

- Phone number: 16600195000

### Agriculture and child labor

According to the latest ILO estimates, at least 250 million children of between 5-14 years of age work in developing countries. Almost half of these children work on a full-time basis. The participation rates of children in economic activities in much higher in rural areas than in urban centres. Rural children, in particular girls, tend to start working at an early age. In Latin America and the Carribbean, out of 15 million children involved in the labor market, 56 percent work in agriculture sector from the age of 5 to 7 onwards. In some countries, children account for as much as 30 percent of the agricultural workforce. Most children work seven days a week and are paid less than the prevailing rates in their localities. They work long hours, and a very high proportion of these children are injured at work. Exposure to poor working conditions has serious repercussions on children's growth, development and health. The most common injuries include: cuts and wounds, eye infection, skin problems, fever, and headaches caused by excessive heat or by exposure to pesticides while working in agricultural fields.

### Hazards in agriculture occupation

Despite the fact that certain developing countries have reached higher levels of economic development, nutrition and health are still the problem areas. This situation provokes a vicious circle of low productivity, low wages, malnutrition, ill-health and low working capacity. The interaction between poor living and working conditions determines a distinctive morbidity-mortality pattern among agricultural workers, which is due to the combination of malnutrition, general and occupational diseases, and complications arising from undiagnosed or untreated diseases. Low working capacity is closely related to workers' malnutrition and poor health. 

Agriculture related hazards mostly include:

1. Machinery such as tractors, trucks and harvestors, and cutting and piercing tools;
2. Hazardous chemicals: Pesticides, fertilizers, antibiotics and other veterinarian products;
3. Toxic or allergenic agents: Plants, flowers, dusts, animal waste, gloves, chrome, oils;
4. Carcinogenic substances or agents: Certain pesticides such as arsenicals and phenoxy-acetic herbicides, UV radiations, parasitic diseases such as bilharziasis and facioliasis;
5. Transmissible animal diseases: brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, hydatid disease, tularaemia, rabies;
6. Other infectious and parasitic diseases: leishmaniasis, bilharziasis, facioliasis, malaria, tetanus, mycosis;
7. Confined spaces such as silos, pits, cellars and tanks;
8. Noise and vibration;
9. Ergonomic hazards: use of inadequate equipment and tools, unnatural body position or prolonged static postures, carrying of heavy loads, repetitive work, excessive long hours;
10. Extreme temperatures and adverse weather conditions;
11. Contact with wild and poisonous animals: insect, spider, scorpion, snake and certain wild mammals.
