,Nutrient (Element),Role of nutrients,Deficiency symptoms of nutrients,Control of deficiency,Symptoms under excess nutrients
1,Nitrogen (N),1. It is constituent of chlorophyll.,1. Lower leaves turn yellow,1. Use of nitrogen fertilizer in the soil,1. Blackening around tips of older leaves
,,2. N makes plant dark green,2. Growth of plant is stunted,2. Foliar spray of urea,2. Delays maturity
,,"3. It increases vegetative growth, protein content and cation exchange capacity in plant roots",3. Shedding of leaves and fruits,,3. Encourages Lodging
,,4. Encourage the formation of good quality foliage,,,4. Makes plant more susceptible to pests and diseases
,,,,,5. Poor root growth
2,Phosphorus (P),1. Stimulates root growth and formation,1. Leaves become smaller in size,"1. Application of phosphatic fertilizers in the soil, e.g., super phosphate",1. Necrosis and tip dieback
,,2. Helps in cell division,2. Leaves and stems become purple,,2. Interveinal chlorosis in younger leaves
,,3. Hasten maturity,3. Delay in maturity,,3. Marginal scorch of older leaves
,,"4. Makes plant more tolerant to drought, cold, insects and diseases",4. Growth is stunted,,
,,5. Increase P and Ca in plants,,,
,,6. Increase tillers and ratio of grain to straw in crop,,,
3,Potassium (K) (Kalium),1. K–helps in translocation,1. Margin of leaves turn brown and dry up,"1. Use of potassic fertilizer in the soil e.g., muriate of potash",Plants have luxury consumption hence not toxic
,,"2. Imparts, vigour and growth to plants",2. The older leaves develop brown colour,,
,,"3. Makes plant more tolerant to drought, cold insects and diseases.",3. Stunted growth,,
,,4. Reduces lodging,,,
,,5. Increases the availability of N and P,,,
,,6. Increases the size of root and tuber,,,
4,Calcium (Ca),1. Promotes early root growth,1. Terminal bud dies,1. Use of calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide in the soil,
,,2. Ca is constituent of cell,2. Leaves become wrinkled,2. Use of gypsum,
,,3. Increases stiffness of straw (stem),3. new leaves shows symptoms,,
,,4. Improves soil structure,,,
,,5. Keeps soil neutral,,,
5,Magnesium (Mg),1. Constituent of chlorophyll,1. Vein of leaves remain green and inter-veinal chlorosis,1. Foliar application of magnesium sulphate (Epsum),1. May induce K deficiency
,,2. Increases photosynthesis,2. Symptoms on older leaves,,
,,3. Regulates uptake of nutrients,,,
,,4. Promotes the formation of oils and fats,,,
6,Sulphur (S),1. Helps in chlorophyll formation,1. The whole leaf in plant has light green colour,1. Foliar application of sulphur or sulphate,1. Reduction in leaf size
,,2. Stimulates root growth seed formation and nodule formation,,,
,,3. Encourages plant growth,,,
,,4. S is constituent of enzymes and proteins,,,
7,Iron (Fe),1. Helps in chlorophyll formation,1. Yellowing of new check leaves,Spraying of 0.5% Ferrous sulphate on foliage,Bronzing of older leaves is common in low land rice grown under acid soils
,,2. Acts as an oxygen carrier,2. Chlorosis,,
,,3. Helps in protein synthesis,,,
8,Manganese (Mn),1. Acts as a catalyst in oxidation reduction reaction,1. Brown patch on leaves,1. Soil or foliar application of manganese sulphate,1. Spots on the veins of the leaf blade and leaf sheath
,,2. Act as activator of many enzymes,2. Reddening of leaves in cotton,,2. Stunted plant
,,3. Helps in Chlorophyll synthesis,,,
9,Boron (B),1. Helps in uptake and utilization of calcium,1. The leaves thicken and margin roll upward,1. Foliar spray of boric acid or borax,1. Inter veinal chlorosis at the tips of the older leaves along the margins
,,2. Helps in protein synthesis,2. Younger leaves are dwarf,2. Use of boron in soil,2. Leaves turn brown and dry up
,,,3. Top-rot diseases of tobacco,,
10,Copper (Cu),1. Helps in oxidation–reduction reaction,,,
11,Molybdenum (Mo),1. Helps in absorbing atmospheric nitrogen by nodule bacteria in legume,1. Petiole of the leaves remain intact but shedding of margin and other part of leaves,1. Soil or foliar application of sodium molybdate or ammonium molybdate,Not common
,,2. Helps in protein synthesis,2. Curling of leaves,,
12,Chlorine (Cl),1. Essential for photosynthesis process,1. Yellowing of leaves (white plant),1. Potassium chloride application in the soil,1. Burning of leaf tips or margins
,,2. Keeps osmotic pressure normal in cell sap,,,2. Reduce leaf size
13,Zinc (Zn),1. Constituent of a number of enzymes,1. White leaf become rusty-brown in colour,1. Soil application of Zinc sulphate @ 25-50 Kg/ha.,1. Induces iron chlorosis
,,2. Helps in formation of growth hormones,2. Stunted growth,2. Foliar application of 0.5% zinc sulphate,
,,3. Act as catalyst in chlorophyll formation,,,
