<li>A developing (of a low and middle income country; LMIC/LEDC) is a country with a less developed industrial base and low HDI relative to other countries.</li>
<li>In the 2016 edition of its World Development Indicators, the World Bank made a decision to no longer distinguish between “developed” and “developing” countries in the presentation of its data, considering the two-category distinction outdated. Instead, the World Bank classifies countries into four groups, based on Gross National Income per capita, re-set each year on July 1. In 2016, the four categories in US dollars were:
<ul>
<li>Low income countries: $995 or less</li>
<li>Lower middle income countries: $996 to $3,895</li>
<li>Upper middle income countries: $3,895 to $12,055</li>
<li>High income countries: $12,056 and above</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Third world:
Over the past few decades since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the term Third World has been used interchangeably with developing countries, but the concept has become outdated in recent years as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world. The three-world model arose during the Cold War to define countries aligned with NATO (the First World), the Communist Bloc (the Second World, although this term was less used), or neither (the Third World). Strictly speaking, “Third World” was a political, rather than an economic, grouping.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.1</span> Climate change and energy use</h3>
<p>Arguments:
- Energy use has close ties with climate change. India and china are among the greatest emitters of greenhouse gases and consumers of fossil fuel, and it is predicted that their consumption of coal as major source of energy will continue to rise for at least a decade (IEA, 2019).
- Into 2016 and we still have 80% of our total energy requirement met from fossil fuels (mostly, oil, coal and natural gases). International energy agency’s report says that 30% of all energy-related carbon dioxide emission is related to coal as fuel, making it the biggest single contributor (2019).
- An individual effort to parsimoniously treat energy resources available to us determines individual footprint. We could choose to reuse a battery/cell, with minor power drops, in alternative electronic items compatible with it or just treat at a refuse at our home. The latter activity with unforeseen consequences might lead to the battery being disposed improperly and polluting an ecosystem due the leakage of its electrolyte chemicals.
- While electricity is lighting up most houses, its generation has been a markedly different process worldwide. The process basically depends with the resource endowment of a nation in their approach to choosing ways to explore it. Coal, for example, is used largely in China and the US despite its much tauted big contribution in greenhouse emission.</p>
