In 2010, Cooperative development department was established. In 2013, government implemented executive guidelines. In 2016, Cooperative organization act came into force. In 2018, Cooperative organization regulations came into force. In 2019, Cooperative training center was established. In 2020, Cooperative bank was established. In 2024, “Village return campaign” was initiated under cooperative program. In 2027, Agriculture development bank started managing cooperative organizations. In 2033, “Sajha” program was implemented in 30 districts establishing multipurpose cooperatives in VDCs. In 2035, Agriculture development bank handed over the managerial responsibility of cooperatives to management board. In 2041, Cooperative (“Sajha”) organization act came into force. In 2048, National cooperative development board was set up. In 2048, Cooperative act came into force (new) In 2049, National Cooperative Association was established. In 2069, Ministry of cooperative and poverty alleviation was formed. Cooperative campaign was first initiated when implementing first five year plan (In 2013), wherein Rapti Dunn Project was launched and 378 cooperative organizations were established in the course. Importance of cooperatives Poverty alleviation Social and economic support to low income households Combines efforts of small producers and consumers and leads them to a larger scale commercial operation Reduces transaction cost, when compared to individual efforts Reduces chances of suppression and exploitation by large scale acting merchants Effective utilization of available resources and supplies Empowerment of local community Qualitative development of labor Improves bargaining power Has a bigger role in operationizing in market demand and supply forces Members have ownership in rural development Promotion of community welfare Community development based on justice and equality Produce can have more accessible market Quality service could be delivered Effective mobilization of consumable goods Support in national economy 10th five year plan focused on emphasized agriculture based commerce and industries, cooperative farming, cooperative based agriculture input supply, and cooperative based small farmer irrigation project implementation, dairy collection and supply and other cooperative based approach to community development. The plan promoted active participation of cooperative groups and private sectors for the efforts. National agriculture policy, 2061 has prioritized cooperative based agriculture industries and commerce promotion, farmer group cooperative formation and agriculture wholesale market and haat bazzar established and management via cooperatives. To legalize a cooperative organization establishment, it should be registered: Under Organization act in District Administration Office, or According to Cooperative act and regulations under Cooperative Division Office. 2.3 Budget speech, 2076-77 BS Total budget announced was Rs 1.53 trillion for fiscal year 2019/20 (76/77).

FAO defined food security in 1996 A.D. In 1996, convention held in Rome approved seven points of food soverignty. Nepal has been a member of FAO since 2007 BS (1950 AD). McMichael’s projection: - 2 billion people suffer hidden hunger - 1.5 billion people suffer over nutrition related problems Since 1981 (2038 BS), FAO started celebrating World Food Day on October 16th. In Nepal, 34th World Food Day was celebrated in 2014 with the slogan: “Feeding the world, caring for the earth”. According to FAO’s projection, 52% of the population in South Asia are dependent on Agriculture while agriculture contributes 22% to the total GDP in the region. Pillars of food security: Food availability Food access Nepal’s poverty rate in 2001/2002 AD: 30% Nepal’s poverty rate in 2010 AD: 26% Nepal’s poverty rate at the end of 12th plan: 23.8% Food utilization Per person per day recommendation by WHO: 250 ml milk (91 ltr per year) Nepal’s aim for per day milk consumption: 156 ml (57 ltr per year) Nepal’s aim for per year meat consumption: 14 kg Nepal’s aim for per year egg consumption: 48 30% of total daily protein requirement should be met by animal sources. Food stability In 2011 AD, Nepal ranked 157th among 187 nations in HDI In 2014 AD, Nepal ranked 145th in HDI Poverty rate at village/rural areas: 27% (Survey, 2012) Poverty rate at cities: 15% (Survey, 2012) Monthly poverty: Maximum at Chaitra-Baisakh Minimum at Mangsir-Poush State of food security in Nepal: Untill 2042 BS (1985), production was twice that satisfied the population’s need. Upto 2047 BS, food insufficieny was absent. Currently 40 districts are declared food minimum and more than 27 districts of high hill and mountain districts are food insecure. Calorie deficiency is prevalent in 41% of population. In 19 districts of Midwestern Development Region and Eastern Development Region, food security project is launched. 46% of the total cultivated area is under rice. Of the total food production, contribution of respective crops are: Rice: 56% Maize: 24% Wheat: 17% Millet: 3.6% Barley: 0.29% 2.5 Nepal agriculture research council Has following organizational structure: Executive director Director, Planning and cooperation Director, Crop and horticulture research Director, Livestock and fisheries research Director, Employee administration Director, Economic adminsistration Head, Planning commission Communication, publication and inventory commission Socio-economic and agricultural research policy commission External research directorate Agriculture environment directorate Programs under Agronomic and horticultural crop research programs Rice crop research program, Baniniya, Dhanusha Maize research program, Rampur, Chitwan Wheat crop research program, Bhairahawa, Rupandehi Legume crop research program, Nepalgunj Oil crop research program, Nawalpur, Sarlahi Hilly crop research program, Kavre, Dolakha Sugarcane research program, Jitpur, Bara Potato research program, Khumaltar Ginger research program, Salyan Orange variety research program, Dhankuta Jute crop research program, Itahari, Sunsari National commercial agriculture research program, Pakhribas, Dhankuta Divisions situated in Khumaltar Crop science division Crop disease science division Entomology science division Soil science division Agri-engineering division Agri-botany division Horticulture research division Food research division Biotechnology division Commercial crop division Seed science and technology research division Regional agriculture research centres and programs Regional agriculture research centre, Nepalgunj ARC, Surkhet ARC, Doti ARC, Jumla, Bijayanagar ARC, Jumla, Rajikot ARC, Dolakha Regional agriculture research centre, Lumle ARC, Baidam, Pokhara \\(\\rightarrow\\) Aquaculture ARC, Begnas, Pokhara \\(\\rightarrow\\) Aquaculture ARC, Malepatan, Pokhara \\(\\rightarrow\\) Horticulture ARC, Bandipur, Tanahun \\(\\rightarrow\\) Goat Regional agriculture research centre, Parwanipur ARC, Rasuwa \\(\\rightarrow\\) Pasture ARC, Ranighat, Birgung, Parsa \\(\\rightarrow\\) Agri-machinery ARC, Trishuli \\(\\rightarrow\\) Acquaculture ARC, Belachhapi, Dhanusha \\(\\rightarrow\\) Tobaccoo Regional agriculture research centre, Tarahara Pakhribas, Dhankuta Tarahara \\(\\rightarrow\\) Aquaculture "],

By the end of this stage, the base of stem and the bases of all leaves are concealed when plant is viewed from above. The innermost heart leaves are growing in an upright fashion and are visible without moving any of the surrounding leaves. Cupping: Approximately 20-26 leaves. The innermost heart leaves, which are still growing in an upright fashion, are concealed by the larger, older leaves surrounding them. All visible leaves will later become the frame leaves (leaves not touching the mature head) of the mature plant. Early head formation: Approximately 2.5-4 inch diameter head. The inner heart leaves, now quickly developing as a ball-like structure of overlapping leaves, are concealed by the surrounding larger leaves. These leaves do not press tightly against the developing head and will later unfold to become frame leaves. Head fill: Approximately 3-8 inch diameter head. A firm round head is visible within the wrapper leaves (the 4 outer loose leaves that touch the mature head). The head has not yet fully developed and thus, is not of harvestable size. Mature: Approximately 6-12 inch diameter head. No new visible leaf production will occur after the head has attained maximum hardness and size. The head is ready for harvest and may split if not harvested in time. 3.2 Citrus cultivation 3.2.1 Principal rootstocks Today, five types of rootstock predominate in relatively not cool climates where cold or freezing weather is not probable, especially Florida and southern Europe. Sour orange rootstock: it is the only rootstock that truly is an orange (the Citrus ? aurantium or bitter orange). It is vigorous and highly drought-resistant. Poncirus trifoliata: it is a close relative of the Citrus genus, sometimes classified as Citrus trifoliata. It is especially resistant to cold, the tristeza virus, and the fungus Phytophthora parasitica (root rot) and grows well in loam soil. Among its disadvantages are its slow growth-it is the slowest growing rootstock-and its poor resistance to heat and drought. It is primarily used in China, Japan, and areas of California with heavy soils. Swingle citrumelo: it is tolerant of tristeza virus and Phytophthora parasitica and moderately resistant to salt and freezing. This rootstock selection was hybridized from the Duncan grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macfadyen) and the Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. by Walter Tennyson Swingle in Eustis, Florida, in 1907. It was released by the US Department of Agriculture to nurserymen in 1974. Troyer citrange and Carrizo citrange: these reasonably vigorous rootstocks are resistant to Phytophthora parasitica, nematodes, and tristeza virus and show good cold tolerance. They also are highly polyembryonic, so growers can obtain multiple plants from a single seed. Citrange, however, does not do well in clay, calcareous or high-pH soils, and is sensitive to salinity. It is not feasible as rootstock for mandarin scions, as it overgrows them by producing branches of its own in competition with the grafted budwood.[3] Citranges are hybrids of the Washington navel orange and the Poncirus trifoliata. The original crosses, made in the early 1900s by the U.S. Department of Agriculture with the intention of producing cold tolerant scion varieties, were later identified as suitable for use as rootstocks. The commercial use of these rootstocks began in Australia in the 1960s. The Troyer variety generally is found in California, while the Carrizo variety is used in Florida. Cleopatra mandarin: it is tolerant of salinity and soil alkalinity and also suitable for shallow soils. It is used primarily in Spain, Australia, and Florida. Dade County, for example, has 85% calcareous soil, a typical trait of land that has been under water.[4] The Cleopatra mandarin, originated in India and introduced into Florida from Jamaica in the mid-nineteenth century, has been distributed and tested as a rootstock throughout the world. Nowadays, however, it is considered an inferior rootstock because it is sensitive to many diseases, grows slowly, and is difficult to propagate. 3.3 Guava cultivation Psidium guajava (Myrtaceae) Origin: Tropical america; originated in the warm, lowland tropics Contains low energy, low fat and high amounts of vitamin C. Commercial trade is smaller in volume compared to other fruits. 3.3.1 Morphology and Botany Photoperiod insensitive Can be forced to flower by pruning Woody is hardy; resistant to strong winds. The rhythmic flushing of vegetative growth and flowering influences when and how pruning is carried out. Guavas are forced to produce year round, and normally the actively growing shoots are tipped once they become too large. This tipping forces regrowth and new flowers to be induced, to keep production high and constant. As soon as the harvest is finished, a peripheral pruning of the canopy is performed, in order to force new shoots that will bear flowers. 3.3.2 Climate and soil Temperature lower than \\(8\\ ^\\circ C\\) is inappropriate for commercial cultivation. Moderately tolerant to saline conditions. 3.3.3 Varieties Lucknow-49, Allahabad safeda, Seedless 3.3.4 Propagation Stem and root cuttings, Air layering and Budding Guava trees propagated by grafting have tap roots that provide substantial anchorage. Trees propagated by cuttings have weaker root systems. 3.3.5 Planting and orchard establishment Spacing with fillers: 3.1 x 7.6 (424 trees/ha) Permanent spacing: 6.2 x 7.6 (212 trees/ha), or 4.6 x 7.6 (286 trees/ha) Table 3.1: Climacteric and non climacteric fruits commonly cultivated in Nepal climacteric non_climacteric Avocado Litchi Banana Mangosteen Guava Pineapple Mango Mountain apple (Bayer) Papaya Sapota 3.3.6 Post-harvest High moisture loss occurs No dramatic change in taste during storage at higher temperatures (10-15 \\(\\ ^o C\\)) Horticulture development and plans and policies Q. Government plans and policies have given priority on horticulture. However, the potentiality of fruit sector (an important component of horticulture) has not been exploited properly. In this context, discuss the current problems relating to fruit crop development in Nepal. A. \\(\\longrightarrow\\) Although the long term Agriculture Perspective Plan fared well with the set target in horticulture sector (along with roads and community forest) during the implementation period of 1995-2015, overall history of horticulture sector is less than satisfying in Nepal. The total area, productive area, production and productivity of fruits in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2014/15 are 150387 ha, 110802 ha, 992703 mt and 8.96 mt/ha respectively (Table ). Recent data shows that contribution of horticulture sector amounts to 15% of the Agriculture GDP. Fruit sub-sector contributes 5.24 ??(when) percent in Agricultural GDP. Besides government engaging in active production of fruit seedlings and provisioning gardening tools, many private firms are working on production of quality planting materials. Out of total area occupied by fruits 57% are tropical, 26% are citrus and only 17% are temperate fruit species. Similarly, total area covered by fruits is 4.79% of total cultivated area. It was found that the productivity trend is increasing from 2005/06 (9.47mt/ha) to 2011/12 AD (10.17 mt/ha) and decreasing in 2012/13 (9.25 mt/ha) and in 2013/14 (8.77mt/ha). There is huge gap between exported (24812.17 mt) and imported (2,27,00,266 mt) scenario of different fruits which indicates the immense scope of fruit development in Nepal. Out of 470 fruit nurseries 272 were registered and 198 were non registered. Currently, more than 90% of the citrus seedlings are annually distributed by private fruit nurseries. Technical support services to the fruit growers are also being provided by government farms in their command areas and to the pocket areas of the targeted districts through the extension service. Table 3.2: Status of fruits and vegetable production and area during recent 3 years. Description Component 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 Fruit Area 110086 110802 110586 Fruit Production 965044 991978 976461 Vegetable Area 254931 266937 280807 Vegetable Production 3421035 3580084 3929034 About 3-4 percent of cultivated land is under fruit acreage. This could be observed from the table below showing the annual cultivation trend since 2005-06 AD. There is an increasing trend in area coverage and fruit production but the yield per hectare is low in comparison with other fruit producing countries. The fruit production needs to be increased to meet the increasing demand for domestic consumption and for exports as well. There are some important issues like infrastructure, physical and environmental, agronomic and technical support post harvest losses, problem oriented research and transfer of technology, which need to be addressed to promote fruit development in the country. There are 45 species belonging to 37 genera of wild edible fruits. Even seasonal fruits harvested from forests can be seen in several local markets. Despite of increasing area and production and huge potential of fruit cultivation in the country, the quantity and value of foreign import of fruits is increasing in recent years due to higher rate of the increasing internal demand in comparison to rate of increasing domestic production and supply. The per capita availability of fruit in the fiscal year 2014/15 was 34 kg/year. Major problems relating to development of fruit crops in particular, and horticulture sector in general, are as follows: Despite immense potential of hoticultural crops, upto 80% of the cultivated land in Nepal is used to grow cereal crops. Out of remaining 20% cultivated land, most of which are located in more northern latitudes, suitability of fruit farming in those lands is fringe. Most are rocky terrains with steep slopes and young soil. In addition, hilly regions of Nepal suffer a major setback on soil moisture management, which is critical for a fruit orchard. Without a proper buffer against hailstorm and snowfall, substantial amounts of fruit drops and wastage have been noted. Since a long time past, unavailability of inputs like inorganic fertilizers, progagation materials have hindered progressive farming. Rural farmers are forced to opt for low input management which only give marginal yields and limits the productivity improvement. Furthermore, as fruit crops are given an inferior status relative to cereals, farmhold themselves are negligent about timely provisioning of agricultural inputs for fruit orchard. Irrigation management Postharvest handling Marketing and transport APP was based on a narrow viewpoint of technology – excessively focused on green revolution perspective that is not appropriate for large parts of Nepalese agroecology. Horticulture sector in particular is largely hurt by this conservative view point of technology adoption. This sector has poorly prospered in terms of access to infrastructure and is one of the least industrially benefitting ones. As hills and rural parts of country are infact the major hubs of vegetable and fruit production, policy emphasis on adoption of more capital intensive technology i.e., that which characterizes green revolution, is just a dream chase afterall. On the other hand, Nepal has areas where specialized farming systems, such as organic citrus and apple production system, could flourish. These regions would have sought mostly technical support for quality assurance, policy support for certification, and basic resource support. All of this were lacking in places such as Mustang, Dolpa and Jumla, where organic apple production could have comparative advantage. With the diverse agroecology, we have southern terai regions suited for cultivation of tropical fruits while mid-hills and high-hills towards north being suitable for sub-tropical to warm and cold temperate fruit and nut species. Research and development programs are not found to have exerted impact on all agroecologies, mostly that of Far Western Development Region of Nepal. There still are several fruit and nut crops that have a greater local demand but are not being integrated into mainstream research and crop development process. Fruit nuts such as chestnut ( Castanea spp.), Sapota, Rubus berry are underutilized while some are at best only identified. Thus, in meeting increasing need of human nutrition and feeding urban population, these minor fruits could play an important role. Policy level and action oriented strategies that have been or could potentially be taken by Government to uplift horticulture sector include improvement in mainly following aspects: The Decentralization strategy of ADS foresees a decentralized structure of Nepalese Agricultural Research, with establishment of new national research institutes (eg, a National Horticultural Research Institute, National Animal Health Research Institute, and National Aquaculture and Fisheries Research Institute), establishment of a National Agricultural Research Fund (NARF) under NARC, and the establishment of research stations in all regions, including the far western region. Nutritional aspect of food security has a prominent role of hoticultural crops. Because fruits and vegetables supply the bulk of fiber, minerals and vitamins, meeting nutritional need of growing urban cummunity is possible only through empowering of horticulture sector. ADS highlights following key strategies in improvement of fruit sub-sector of horticulture: Formulation and implementation of appropriate land use policy which will significantly help area expansion of horticulture and plantation crops. Rejuvenation of old, unproductive, senile plantations through substitution of old varieties with improved high yielding varieties. Development of demand-driven technology on improved varieties, cultural operations, pest management, harvesting, post-harvest handling, marketing and processing; promotion of value chain approach in extension and development. Public private partnership in developing irrigation schemes including the micro-irrigation, collection centers, wholesale markets, cold storage, processing industries, and encouragement and promotion of packaging and grading centers Planning and prioritization of HHVCs’ development in the form of projects on the basis of domestic and external demands, economic viability, comparative advantage, employment and income generation, environmental sustainability and use of local resources. Enforcement of laws and regulations to ensure adherence to safety, hygiene and other standards as per SPS through relevant public institutions and local authorities. Strengthening of present organizations responsible for horticultural and HVC development in the country to be made more accountable to carry out the work responsibilities with new vision, or preferably a separate competent horticulture authority established to coordinate inter and intra ministerial, institutional and departmental agencies and programs. Deployment of technically skilled and capable manpower in adequate numbers on the basis of research, extension and training in relation to area of operation and volume of production; and Formulation of long-term commodities development plans with program wise investment plans and encouraging significant participation and investment of private sectors in promotion, processing and marketing of HHVCs. Increased productivity of fruit proposed for ADS implementation period is from 10 to 15 Mt/ha 3.4 National fruit development directorate (Institutional development of fruits) The agro-ecological conditions of Nepal are very much suitable for the successful cultivation of large number of fruit species. Growing of fruits in homestead gardens is a traditional practice in Nepal since time immemorial. The systematic fruit development program in Nepal was initiated in a planned manner since 1960. Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) stressed development activities for commercial production of two major high value fruit crops such as Apple in high hills &amp; Citrus (especially Mandarin) in mid-hills. The emphasis was given on pocket-package development strategy, which must be carried out as a campaign on a participatory basis from the grass-root level to higher ups. The other fruits of the commercial importance such as Mango, Litchi and Banana etc. are also addressed near/along the highway corridors of Terai and inner Terai belts so as to meet the fruit requirements in the country. However, horticulture sector has not gained the level of expected industrialization/commercialization due to various constrains. Fruit Development Directorate (FDD) was first established as Horticulture Section in 1955, which evolved as Fruit Development Section in 1966, Fruit Development Division in 1990 and the directorate in 2000. FDD is the central body responsible for the development of fruits, coffee, tea and ornamental crops in the country. National Centre for Fruit Development was established in 2018 after restructure under federal system for Fruit Development Directoriate, National Citrus Development Programme and Coffee and Tea Development Section. 3.5 Environmental stress factors in horticulture Q. What are the important climatic factors that are considered as extreme environmental stress? Suggest their possible control measures. A. \\(\\longrightarrow\\) Climate is a combination of aboveground environmental factors – temperature, moisture, sunlight and air – and is characteristic of a region. It determines what crops can be cultivated in a given area. However, alike climate belowground environmental factors – soil temperature, soil moisture, soil physical characteristics, soil chemical properties, organic matter, etc., also play a role in determining success of a crop in a given agricultural region. Environmental stresses play crucial role in the productivity, survival and reproductive biology of fruit plants as well as crops. Biotic and abiotic stresses, including drought, extreme temperature, scarcity of water, reducing quality of irrigation water and salinity in soil and water are problems which are becoming really acute. Due to their rapid and unpredictable effects, it is becoming very difficult for horticultural scientists and farmers to respond to challenges posed by biotic and biotic stresses. Some of the climatic parameters and the stress associated with them, influencing crop development and yield are: Water and moisture stress: Required in several stages of crop’s life cycle – germination. Much of the water requirement is met from the precipitation (including the rain and the snow) and evaporation. Lack of moisture in the aboveground environment makes the air less humid, thereby increasing its drying power. The rates of plant processes such as transpiration, diffusion, and evaporation are affected directly by the vapor pressure of the air (the part of the total air pressure attributable to the water molecules present in the air). As previously indicated, if air temperature is increased but the amount of water vapor in the air stays the same, the relative humidity of the air decreases. Excessive moisture in the microclimate of plants predisposes them to disease. Temperature and temperature stress: Temperature is the intensity of heat energy and very vital in regulating the plant’s biological, chemical and physiological processes, mostly by regulating rate of chemical reactions. Several crops show temperature dependent growth periodicity, i.e. some crops tend to flower in higher temperature of summer season while fruits like apple and ornamental bulbs such as daffodil ( Narcissus) and hyacinth ( Hyacinthus)require a period of chiling temperature to break the dormancy and initiate flowering. Similarly hardiness of a crop is defined for various temperature scales within a range of \\(0-50 ^\\circ C\\). Extremely high temperature kills plants ouright or reduces production severely, when such prevalence coinicides with flowering and fruiting periods. actively growing, succulent tissue in plant parts such as flower buds are more susceptible than dormant tissue to cold damage. Frost damage is critical when flower buds start to open. Warm-season crops are more prone to frost damage. Light and light associated stress: The role of light in the growth and development of horticultural plants depends on its quality, quantity, and daily duration. olar radiation is electromagnetic in nature. Radiant energy is described by its wavelength and frequency. The shorter the wavelength and higher the frequency, the higher the energy transmitted. Sunrise and sunset patterns differ from one season to another. Incident light angles are wider in summer than in winter and hence the light intensity is higher in summer months. Even the daily light-dark duration varies over an annual cycle. In winter months dark hours are longer and light hours are shorter, and vice versa for summer months. This gives rise to a physiological behavior in some plants called photoperiodism, which is characterized by the flowering time variation of crop plants based on the light-dark period. One one extreme end, plants exposed continually to very low light intesities exibhit tall statures, yellowing of leaves and lean stem, a condition called etiolation. Likewise light quality affects color development and tillering and branching behavior in grass crops. Four photoperiodic responses in plants are a basis for classifying horticultural plants: Short-day plants (or long-night plants). Short-day plants will not flower under continuous light. They require a photoperiod of less than a certain critical value within a 24-hour daily cycle. For example, strawberry (Fragaria x ananasia) requires 10 hours of light or less and violet (Viola papilionacea) requires 11 hours. Poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) requires 12.5 hours of daylight and cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) requires about 16 hours or less of light. When planted in the field, short-day plants flower in early spring or fall. Long-day plants (or short-night plants). Long-day plants are plants that flower only when light periods are longer than a certain critical length. These plants flower mainly in summer and include annuals such as henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), which requires more than 10 hours of light, and spinach (Spinacia oleracea), which requires 13 hours of light. Baby’s breath (Gypsophila paniculata) requires 16 hours or more of daylight in order to flower. Day-neutral plants. Day-neutral plants are not responsive to photoperiod and flower according to the developmental stage. Plants in this category include tomato, corn, and cucumber. Intermediate-day plants. Certain grasses such as Indian grass do not flower if the days are too short or too long. These plants are said to have two critical photoperiods and are categorized as intermediate-day plants. Some strategies can be duely adopted to minimize the effects of climate associated stress. There are many approaches like: Growers should make use of weather forecast, Stubble/plastic mulching to check competative weed growth and conserve moisture. Drip and sprinkler irrigation to continually maintain required moisture Mist irrigation to maintain appropriate level of atmospheric humidity Physiological drought resistance of plants through the use of growth retardants, and anti-transpirants Construction of specialized structure such as hot beds, hot caps, polyethylene tunnels, shelterbelts, wind machines, etc. based on necessity. Proper orchard geometry and nutrient management, and Use of rootstocks tolerant to physiological stresses. Beside climatic factors themselves, geographical processes such as relief, orientation and exposure of the fruit orchard, presence or absence of water bodies and vegetation in the vicinity, etc. vastly influence growth of fruit crops. As an example, Colder and heavier air occurring at higher altitudes moves down and pushes the warmer and lighter air upward. This air convection leaves the higher band of land warmer. This thermal belt is warm and permits the culture of frost-sensitive crops on certain parts of slopes in areas that are normally too cold for growing crops. 3.6 Tissue culture and significance in Nepal Q. What do you understand by tissue culture? Describe it’s role in fulfiling the need of seed requirement to Nepalese farmers. A. \\(\\longrightarrow\\) The branch of biology in which tissues or cells of higher animals and plants are grown artificially in a controlled environment. As a method of propagation of horticultural crops, from amongst a range of options available to propagate a plant, tissue culture is one of the major biotechnology activity of public as well as private sectors. Protocols have been developed for in vitro propagation of different species (both animals and plants) elsewhere in the world to be used readily or with some modifications. The first extracted tissue (also called explant) changes into a mass of undifferentiated cells called callus, from which differentiation into shoot and root or embryos may later occur. This method of propagation is commercially adopted in herbaceous (e.g., strawberry, banana, gladiolus, tobacco, carnation, and gloxinia) and woody plants (e.g., apple, rose, and rhododendron). In several asexually reproducing crops, maintenance of their quality and adequate quanity over period has been a challenge. This amounts to a large number of seed material (propagule) import from neighboring countries for instant use of Nepalese farmers. However, this situation of excessive reliance on import of basic input can be remedied if tissue culture of relevant crops were practiced in Nepal itself. Mainly focusing on propagule generation of high value and bulky propagule seems to be a profitable venture as fruit and flower crops like those mentioned above can be successfully regenerated in a simply established tissue culture laboratory. A tissue culture laboratory can host seedling at a very small storage space Large number of planting materials can be obtained by establishing cultures and subcultures of different varities/cultivars of crops at the same time, on demand. Typically within a couple of weeks thousands of usable seedlings can be recovered from a single explant. Tissue culture laboratory can be operated at a relatively cheap cost if basic infrastructure like culture medium, sterilants, working and housing facility could be assured. Tissue culture technology using meristem culture can be used to raise virus and pathogen free seedlings, which is not guarenteed by conventional plant part based propagation. Development of hybrid cultivars i.e., that of Brassica napus and B calabrese, exploits an use case of tissue culture called embryo rescue to obtain viable hybrids. 3.7 River basin/bed farming and guidelines Q. If a farmer from a river basin area (600 m) comes to you and request for summer season cucumber cultivation technology what would be your advice to him ? A. \\(\\longrightarrow\\) Riverbed farming can be used to increase household income and to improve the food security of landless and land-poor households in the Terai area of Nepal. It is estimated that about 8,000 hectares of riverbed land would be suitable for agricultural cultivation in the Kailali and Kanchanpur Districts in the Western Terai areas of Nepal. After the river water recedes in the post-monsoon season, vegetables are planted in ditches dug into the seasonal sand banks; the crops are harvested before the onset of the next monsoon. General guidelines for performing riverbed farming: On average, the water table should not be lower than 1 m; when the water table is lower than this, too much labor is required. Ditches are up to 1 m deep and 1 m wide. The length depends on how much land is available. A row-to-row spacing of 2-3 m (between the ditches) and plant-to-plant spacing of 0.5-1 m is required depending on the crop. The ditches are dug in an east-west orientation to maximize the amount of sunshine they receive and to minimize the collection of sand carried by the prevailing winds. Farmers may build shelter close to their plots so that they can be close at hand to fend off thieves and wild animals. Apply fertilizer: farmyard manure/compost about 12 tonnes; urea about 100 kg; di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) about 120 kg; and potash about 30 kg per ha. Plant seeds/seedlings using the appropriate row-to-row (RXR) and plant-to-plant (PXP) distance for at least one crop. Following planting distances are applicable for the crops mentioned herein: 3 m x 1 : Bottle gourd, pumpkin, and water melon and 2 m x 0.5: Bitter gourd and cucumber Following establishment and maintenance inputs are required (per hectare): Labor to prepare plots, irrigation, and to collect mulching materials (165 person days) Equipment: Sprayers, watering can, spades Materials: Polythene bags, sheets, mulching materials Agricultural seeds, chemical fertilizer, farmyard manure, compost, bio-pesticides, micronutrients. 3.8 Potato tuber storage systems Q. Describe various types of storage systems used in Nepal to store potato tubers. A. \\(\\longrightarrow\\) By Samita! 3.9 True potato seed, scope and technology adoption improvement Q. Define True Potato Seed (TPS). Do you see its scope in supplementing the requirement of potato seeds in Nepal ? Is so, how can it be improved ? A. \\(\\longrightarrow\\) Potatoes are most often propagated from vegetative tissues, either whole tubers or cut pieces of tubers. Tubers used for propagation are typically called seed tubers, seed potatoes, or seed pieces. Potato plant can be produced from botanical or sexual seeds, but these “true” potato seeds (TPS) are seldom used, because they are genotypically variable and give rise to plants with traits thay may be completely different from those of the parent plants. A single plant may produce 50-100 berries and single berry contains about 150-200 seeds. TPS is mainly used to develop new potato cultivars and now gaining popularity to raise the commercial crops. About 100-150 g of seed is required to raise the crop in 1 hectare of land. Scope: - Non-availability of good quality seed tuber, - High seed cost, - Virus infilteration in seed tubers causing degeneration of seed stocks - Problem of long distance transport of tuber seeds from seed producing areas All these constraints have led to the development of TPS technology of crop production. Further benefits TPS technology are: Unlike seed tuber, stocking density of TPS seed much more, hence from the same parcel of land, more of TPS can be recovered than seed tuber. An additional benefit with the use of TPS is process to obtaining application ready seed is substantially shortened as several post-harvest processess such as curing and tuber treatment can be avoided.

Differentiate PBS and TPS. How is PBS is produced in Potato ? \\(\\longrightarrow\\) Pre-basic seed (PBS) potatoes are disease free potato minitubers produced by transplanting pathogen free in vitro potato plantlets under protected condition in aphid-proof glasshouse and/or screen house. Potato crop variety is very susceptible to degeneration as it is vegetatively propagated, and tends to accumulate virus load over generation of cropping. Therefore, routine maintenace of seed should be carried out to ensure variety stands to the promised useful features. Following set of steps are usually carried out for production of PBS: Virus elimination Tubers are allowed to sprout for 2-3 weeks under thermal treatment at \\(37^\\circ\\) Shoot tips excised from the sprouts and washed in detergent water Under laminar airflow chamber, shoot surface are sterilized (treated with 70% Ethanol for 30 seconds, washed with sterile distilled water and then sterilized with 2% sodium hypochlorite solution for five minutes and again washed at least three times with sterile distilled water). The apical meristem (with one or two leaf premordia, about 0.2-0.3 mm in diameter) are excised from the shoot tip by viewing under a stereoscopic microscope, and placed on top of a filter paper bridge on a liquid MS medium (Murashige and Skoog 1962) supplemented with \\(0.5 mg l^{-1}\\) IAA, \\(0.4 mg l^{-1}\\) Kinetin and \\(0.1 mg l^{-1}\\) \\(GA 3\\) (Mellor and Stace-Smith 1977). The meristem are then cultured in an incubation room under \\(20\\pm 2^\\circ C\\) with proper illumination (2000 lux) and 16 h photoperiod. After few weeks of culturing, when green pigmentation and stem and leaf tissues are observable, it is transferred to a solid MS medium for proper rooting and shooting. These plantlets can be multiplied into several clones by nodal cuttings. Virus testing: ELISA or related techniques to screen for virus free clones. Assayed clones are further validated for them being virus free with field tests of standing crops in greenhouse. Germplasm maintenance: Virus free clones could be maintained with subsequent subcultures after testing in germplasm laboratory. Rapid propagation: Maintained mother plantlets can be propagated by single nodal cutting on modified MS solid media with supplement. To enhance differentiation and production of apical part including leaves, culture should be incubated in growth chamber with culture conditions of 16 h photoperiod, 2000 lux light intensity and \\(20 \\pm 2^\\circ C\\) temperature. PBS production under controlled conditions: Four to six weeks old in-vitro plantlets are transplanted into sterile mixture of 2:1 sand and soil substrate under aphid-proof glasshouse. Special cultivation techniques assure the quality of propagules. They include: 20 x 10 cm spacing UV sterilized water irrigation and proper irrigation schedule Precise dose fertilizer application Earthing up Plant protection Since the technique used in producing PBS focuses on maintenance of asceptic environment and provides minimum nutrients for early stage plant development, the tuber produce are expected to be low. First generation culture will generally produce small sized tubers. However, a large number of seedlings could be recovered from a tissue cultured plantlets. Since 1990, National Potato Research Program has been producing about 200,000 pre-basic seeds annually. So far, PBS of 19 different recommended and released potato cultivars has been produced. There cultivars have been tested for major potato viruses like PLRV, PVS, PVX, PVY, PVA and PVM. 3.11 Montly crop calendar Baisakh Intercropping of spring season rice, irrigate it and fertilizer application In order to improve soil fertility status of rice field where previously wheat was grown, raise green manuring crop Dhaincha 50 kg per hectare. For establishment of evergreen fruit and flower orchard, perform layout, pit preparation, fertilizer and soil mixing. Okhle-1 and Kavre kodo-1 nursery bed establishment in upper hills. Interculture, earthing up fertilization and irrigation of maize in hills. Application of botanical pesticides (Neem, Timur, Bojho, Artemisia, Thyme, Mustard oil) for control of storage pests. Planting of rainy season maize in terai and inner terai. Planting of forage grass like Teosinte, sorghum, sudan grass, bajra and dinanath grass. Since this time of the year is conducive to spead of Brucellosis and Bhyakute rog, case should be taken to prevent the infection from occuring in cattle shed. Jestha Nursery bed raising of rice Transplanting fingermillet as mixed crop in standing maize field in mid hills Desuckering of fruit orchard Spraying of fungicides in evergreen flowers and fruits Broadcast seed of perinnial grassess in terai and mid hills Control of gundhi bug in spring season rice Planting of Hill, Seti, Ransom and Lumle-1 variety of soybean in hils. Citrus orchard sanitation by application of bordeaux paste in Mandarin and Sweet orange. 3.12 Offseason onion production Owing to the lack of Cold storage facilities and due to reigning high temperature during the months of Ashoj and Kartik, the onion harvested during months of Bhadra and Ashoj months is unlikely to meet demands for later Mangsir and later months. This shortcoming can conveniently be avoided if offseason cultivation of Onion could be done. When onion is grown for fresh leaves and bulbs during the Kartik and Mangsir, such seasonal demand meeting produce is often called offseason. Adding to the availability feature, when sold around these months, produce fetches premium price in the market. Off season onion farming could be done in regions ranging from terai to mid-hills (upto elevation of 1600 masl), however profitable production is being done on lower hills (at 500-1600 masl). Offseason onion farming could basically be done in following ways: Seed to set and set to bulb Seed to bulb Vegetative onion can be obtained directly from seedling cultivation, which is generally established in bulk in nursery bed and disseminated among growers. For simplicity, here is discussed the method of fresh leaf onion and bulb onion production: Selection of land: Onions will grow satisfactorily on soils with a pH of 6.0-6.8. The ratio of N:P:K applied during seedbed preparation is 1:2:2, although some bulb producers increase the nitrogen ratio according to the soil status. Work by Ahmed (1982) showed that N, P and K applications equivalent to 150 kg/ha produced the largest bulbs and highest total bulb yield at the end of the first year, and that supplementary nitrogen application not exceeding 100 kg/ha in the second year applied during anthesis enhanced seed quality. The higher potassium levels during bulb production were carried over to the second year and also enhanced seed quality. Additionally, the land should not permit water stagnation and should drain as early as possible to avoid fungal diseases. Selection of off season cultivar: The best cultivar for raising crop directly from seed is the Agrifound Dark Red. But Nasik-53 is favored when sets are to be raised to obtain bulbs. Seedling raising: Seedling is ready for transplanting within 30-40 day of sowing. Table 3.4: Timing of seed seed preparation and seedling transplanting for offseason onion production. Region Seedling raising time Transplanting time Lower hills Early Ashar Early Shrawan Mid hills Jestha Ashar Seed requirement: 500 g per ropani Raising of seedling bed: - 10 msq of seed bed is enough to raise seedlings for 1 ropani of land. Each meter square of bed optimally receives 50 g. - For healthy seedling raising, bed should be 1 m wide and be raised 30 cm above the ground. - Application of 5 kg: 10 g: 10 g: 10 g FYM:Urea:DAP:MoP per 1 msq seed bed. - If the seed bed is moisture deficit, irrigate it 2-3 days prior to seed placement. - Seed placement in rows of 8-10 cm apart in the bed. - Seed should be thoroughly covered with FYM or fine soil after sowing. Bed should be mulched and be moistened to avoid dessication of seeds underneath. - Healthy seedlings can be obtained if they are primed in sugar+jathropa solution (5:5 g in 20 ml water) and dried. - To prevent seed borned diseases, like seedling rot, spray solution of 2.5 g Dithane-M45, 1 g Bavistin and 1 g Nuvan in 1 ltr water after 1-2 days in seed bed. - Seed bed should always be kept moist. - Apply Micronutrients for healthy and vigorous seedlings. - Seed bed shoudld have provision of drainage to let excess of water. - If early bed is to be constructed in rainy season, bed should be protected from spattering rain by sheltering with polythene. Seedling transplanting - Seedlings become ready for transplantation 30-40 DAS. Only healthy seedlings should be selected for planting. This is fulfiled by roguing out unhealthy ones. - Prior to seedling uprooting, bed should be softened with water. - Based on moisture reign of the land where seedling will be futher grown, provision of irrigation or drainage should be made. Land should be parcelized (into beds) in order to ease operation. - R-R: 20 cm x P-P: 10-15 cm 3.13 Offseason tomato production 3.14 Offseason cucumber production 3.15 Offseason production of other vegetable crops 3.16 What do you understand by tissue culture.

Since then it’s first amendment came into being in 2064. Two step certification/authentication system is practiced in Nepal: Seed certification: Official body responsible for certifying seed in the SQCC. Three classes of seeds are identified: Foundation, Certified-I, Certified-II and Improved under this system. Following activities are carried out in various stages of a crop are crucial for inspection by a seed inspector: Standing crop: By licenced inspector, for field inspection check for crop’s source and seed class, purity, isolation distance, seed affecting diseases, weed and type of varieties. At harvest: Threshing, processing, transporation and storage. After processing: To verify that minimun quality meets, insect damage (In legume: and maize: 1% and other crops: 0.5%), seed moisture, weed and off type seeds, germination percentage Seed is sampled and taken to lab Lab should return results within 30 days of receiving a sample. If suspected, sample may be subjected to grow out test by the tester. If farmer isn’t convinced of the results of the seed testing, s/he may file for recertification. Tagging storage container with certification tag, with signature of certifying inspector. If the seed is to be stored for more than 1 season, the storage sample must be re-certified for quality standards. There are some steps to be followed in prolonging the validity of certification. There are two main types of certification: Minimum standard certification: Location and land requirement fulfilment certification In terai, a minimum of 1 hectares is required for cereal and cash crops. In terai, for vegetables, a minimum of 0.25 hectares is required. In hills, for cereal, a minimum of 0.25 hectare is the necessary criterion. In hills, for vegetables, a minimum of 0.1 ha land should be cultivated with seed under the question. Maximum distance between plots of same certification lot should not exceed 50 m.

Crop is intolerant of water logging. 5.2 Crop coefficients These are the properties of plants used in predicting evapotranspiration (ET). The most basic crop coefficient, \\(k_c\\), is simply the ratio of ET observed for the crop studied over that observed for the well calibrated reference crop under the same conditions. \\[ \\mathrm{PET} = K_c \\times \\mathrm{RET} \\] Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is the evaporation and transpiration that potentially could occur in a field of the crop had an ideal unlimited water supply. RET is the reference ET often denoted as \\(ET_0\\). Even in agricultural corps, where ideal conditions are approximated as much as is practical, plants are not always growing (and therefore transpiring) at their theoretical potential. Plants have growth stages and stages of health induced by a variety of environmental conditions. RET usually represents the PET of the reference crop’s most active growth. \\(K_c\\) then becomes a function or series of values specific to the crop of interest through its growing season. These can be quite elaborate in the case of certain maize varieties, but tend to use a trapezoidal leaf area index (LAI) curve for common crop or vegetation canopies. Stress coefficients, \\(K_s\\), account for diminished ET due to specific stress factors. These are often assumed to combine by multiplication. \\[ \\mathrm{ET_{estimate}} = K_w \\times K_{s_1} \\times K_{s_2} \\times K_c \\times ET_0 \\] Water stress is the most ubiquitous stress factor, often denoted as \\(K_w\\). Stress coefficients tend to be functions ranging between 0 and 1. The simplest are linear, but thresholds are appropriate for some toxicity responses. Crop coefficients can exceed 1 when the crop evapotranspiration exceeds that of RET. Below are given estimates of the crop coefficient for multiple crops commonly cultivated in Nepal Table 5.2: Crop coefficients Crop Approximate duration (days) Month half Jan Feb March April May June July August September October November December Rice (Monsoon) 90 First half 1.10 1.19 0.95 Rice (Monsoon) 90 Second half 1.10 1.10 0.95 Rice (Early) 90 First half 1.10 1.10 1.00 Rice (Early) 90 Second half 1.10 1.10 1.00 Rice (Late) 90 First half 1.10 1.10 0.95 Rice (Late) 90 Second half 1.10 1.10 0.95 Rice (Monsoon) 105 First half 1.10 1.10 0.95 Rice (Monsoon) 105 Second half 1.10 1.10 1.05 0.95 Rice (Early) 105 First half 1.10 1.10 1.00 Rice (Early) 105 Second half 1.10 1.10 1.25 1.00 Rice (Late) 105 First half 1.10 1.10 1.05 0.95 Rice (Late) 105 Second half 1.10 1.10 0.95 Rice (Monsoon) 120 First half 1.10 1.10 1.05 0.95 Rice (Monsoon) 120 Second half 1.10 1.10 1.10 0.95 Rice (Monsoon) 135 First half 1.10 1.10 1.05 0.95 Rice (Monsoon) 135 Second half 1.10 1.10 1.05 1.05 0.95 Rice (Monsoon) 150 First half 1.10 1.10 1.05 1.05 0.95 Rice (Monsoon) 150 Second half 1.10 1.10 1.05 1.05 0.95 Maize 1 105 First half 0.45 0.80 1.05 Maize 1 105 Second half 0.60 1.05 0.80 Maize 2 105 First half 0.45 0.80 1.05 0.80 Maize 2 105 Second half 0.60 1.05 1.05 Pulses 105 First half 0.50 0.95 1.05 Pulses 105 Second half 0.75 1.05 0.96 0.40 Oilseeds 90 First half 0.46 1.00 0.72 Oilseeds 90 Second half 0.82 1.00 0.40 Wheat 1 120 First half 1.15 1.15 0.40 0.65 Wheat 1 120 Second half 1.15 0.90 0.43 1.05 Wheat 2 120 First half 1.05 1.15 0.90 0.43 Wheat 2 120 Second half 1.15 1.15 0.40 0.65 Vegetable (Summer) First half 0.34 0.93 1.05 0.91 Vegetable (Summer) Second half 0.54 1.05 1.04 Vegetable (Winter) First half 0.86 0.95 0.34 Vegetable (Winter) Second half 0.95 0.89 0.28 0.54 Potato 1 130 First half 1.01 1.13 0.94 0.55 Potato 1 130 Second half 1.13 1.08 0.70 0.42 0.79 Potato 2 130 First half 0.79 1.13 1.08 0.77 0.42 Potato 2 130 Second half 1.01 1.13 0.94 0.55 5.3 Estimates of potential evaporation Thornthwaite equation (1948) \\[ PET = 16 \\left(\\frac{L}{12}\\right) \\left(\\frac{N}{30}\\right) \\left(\\frac{10 T_d}{I}\\right)^\\alpha \\] Where, PET is the estimated potential evapotranspiration (mm/month) \\(T_d\\) is the average daily temperature (degree C; if this is negative, use 0) of the month being calculated N is the number of days in the month being calculated L is the average day length (hours) of the month being calculated \\(\\alpha = (6.75 \\times 10^{-7})I^3 - (7.71 \\times 10^{-5})I^2 + (1.792 \\times 10^{-2})I + 0.49239\\) \\(I = \\sum^{12}_{i = 1} {\\left(\\frac{T_{m_i}}{5}\\right)}^{1.514}\\) is the heat index which depends on the 12 monthly mean temperatures \\(T_{m_i}\\). Somewhat modified forms of this equation appear in later publications (1955 and 1957) by Thornthwaite and Mather. Penman equation (1948) The penman equation describes evaporation (E) from an open water surface, and was developed by Howard Penman in 1948. Penman’s equation requires daily mean temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and solar radiation to predict E. Simpler hyrdometeorological equations continue to be used where obtaining such data is impractical, to give comparable results within specific contexts, e.g. humid vs arid climates.

The percentage of people under deprivation is the outcome of equal weight of all dimensions and their respective indicators. The MPI is used to identify a person as multi-dimensionally poor is he or she is deprived in at least one third of the dimensions. MPI of nepal: 2011 \\(\\longrightarrow\\) 0.217 2014 \\(\\longrightarrow\\) 0.127 (NPC, 2019). This means that multidimensionally poor people in Nepal experience 12.7% of the total deprivations that would be experienced if all people were deprived in all indicators. \\(MPI = H \\times A\\) H: The incidence of poverty (or poverty rate; The proportion of people identified as multidimensionally poor). A: The intensity of poverty (of the average proportion of weighted indicators in which the poor are deprived) Values of H and A are, respectively, 28.6% and 44.2% (as of 2014 survey). Provincewise MPI values: Province 1: 0.085 Province 2: 0.217 Province 3: 0.051 Province 4: 0.061 Province 5: 0.133 Province 6: 0.230 Province 7: 0.146 6.2 Human Development Index The HDI is a simple, approximate statistic devised to introduce non-income factors and rival traditional economic indicators within a framework of international development. Formula produces composite statistic of life expectancy, education and income indices, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development, well-being concept based on capability approach. It is annually published by the UNDP since 1990. The index has been developed as a broad proxy intending to stimulate political changes and according to UNDP shall not be considered the only measure of a country’s level of development in general nor the ultimate measure within the concept of human development. Despite shortcommings, HDI is reported to greatly influence policy-makers all around the world, thus contributing to reduction of global poverty. HDI of Nepal was 0.463 (157th position globally), while it was 0.955 (1st position globally) for Norway. HDI of Nepal was 0.54 (145th position globally) 6.3 Gender Development Index (GDI) and Gender Empowerment Index (GEI) The GDI and GEI were introduced in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the UNDP. The aim of these measurements was to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index (HDI). The GDI is defined as a distribution-sensitive measure that accounts for the human development impact on existing gender gaps in the three components of the HDI (Klasen, 1995). The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level of well-being and wealth within a country, but focuses also on how this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society. The HDI and the GDI were created to rival the more traditional general income-based measures of development such as GDP and GNP. GDI, on the other hand, addresses gender-gaps in life expectancy, education, and incomes. It uses an “inequality aversion” penalty, which creates a development score penalty for gender gaps in any of the categories of the HDI which include life expectancy, adulty literacy, school enrollment, and logarithmic transformations of per-capita income. Only the gap between the HDI and GDI can be accurately considered; the GDI on its own is not an independent measure of gender-gaps. The GDI and HDI (women) of Nepal are, respectively, 0.925 and 0.552 as of 2017. This ranks Nepal in 115th position globally. "],

Composition: 0.03%, 0.15%, 1%, etc. Nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) Granulosis virus (GVs) 7.2 Pathogens 7.2.1 Nematodes Nematode is derived from the Greek words, “Nema” = thread/fibre, “toda” = worm. In germany, there is a separate University of Nematology. Nematodes can be defined as unsegmented, bilaterally symmetrical, tryploblastic, pseudocoelomate, invertebrate, and thread like worms. So far 50000 nematode species are recorded worldwide. 10000 are found in fresh water and soil. 300 species are known to be plant parasites. Molya disease ( Heterodera avenae) causes 6-7 crore/year loss in Rajasthan and ear cockle ( Anguina tritici) causes 8 crore loss in India. Radopholus similis was found associated with citrus decline in Florida, USA. In India, Tylenchulus semipenetrans was associated with citrus decline. Plant parasitic nematodes are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented, pseudocelomate and vermiform animals. The body of the nematode may be elongated, spindle shaped, fusiform tapering towards the end but the cross section is always circular. Smallest nematode is 10mm long ( Paralongidorus). Female nematodes are more virulent and agressive than male in attacking and parasitizing the plants. Plant parasitic nematode possess spear or stylet. Nematodes are known to transmit viruses: Two single stranded RNA virus genera, Nepovirus (NEPO) and Tobravirus (TOBRA). 11 species of Xiphinema transmit 13 NEPO virus (Grapevine fan leaf virus) 11 species of Longidorus transmit 10 NEPO virus 14 species of Trichodorus transmit various strains of TOBRA virus: tobacco rattle and pea early browning Insect transmitted viruses Table 7.1: Insect mediated virus transmission Virus Nematode Rice dwarf virus Nephotettix cincticeps Rice tungro virus Nephotettix impicticeps Rice grassy stunt virus Nilaparvata lugens Tomato spotted wilt virus Thrips tabaci, Frankliniella spp. Tomato yellow leaf curl virus Bemisia tabaci Tomato yellow mosaic virus Bemisia tabaci Soybean yellow mosaic Bemisia tabaci Grapevine virus A Pseudococcus longispinus (Mealybugs) Cowpea mosaic virus Epilachna varivestis Potato virus X virus Melanoplus differentialis (Grasshopper) Tobacco mosaic virus Liriomyza langei (Leafminer); Mechanical transmission Onion mosaic virus Eriophyses tulipae (Mites) Soybean mosaic virus Aphids Potato leaf roll virus Myzus persicae 7.3 Crop diseases 7.3.1 Ergot (Wheat, barley, oats, rye, triticale) Hosts: All grasses, particularly, blackgrass ( Alopecurus myosuroides) Symptoms: - Causal fungus only attacks ears of flowering, replacing the grain in a few spikelets by a hard, purple black sclerotium, known as ergot. - Such ergots can be very large, upto 2 cm in length, and very obvious in the standing crop in contaminated grain samples. Life cycle: - Ergot is not truely a seed borne disease, however it can be spread by ergots in contaminated seeds. - At or near harvest, ergots fall to the ground where they remain untill the following summer, when they germinate to produce club-shaped spore bearing structure (stroma). These ascospores are spread by the wind to nearly open flowers of grasses/cereals. The spores germinate in flower, infecting the ovaries. This infection leads to the production of secondary spores (condia) encased in sticky secretion commonly referred to as honeydew. This attracts insects which carry the spores to other flowers, where further infection can occur. - Wheat and other cereals are less severely affected than rye although, occassionally more open-flowerd wheat variety can be badly affected. - Disease is favored by cool, wet conditions during flowering which facilitate spore production and prolong the flowering period, making infection more likely. Importance: - Very little direct effect on yield. - Affects stocks which when fed to flour made with cereals with large amount of toxic alkaloid containing ergot, possess health risks. 7.3.2 Fusarium Fusariusm head blight/ear blight, foot rot, seedling blight Pathogen: Fusarium spp. and Microdochium nivale Hosts: Wheat, barley, oats, rye triticale and grasses. Symptoms: - Form a complex of diseases on seeds, seedlings and adult plants. - Microdochium nivale (formerly known as Fusarium nivale) is seed-borne pathogen and causes seedling blight resulting in seedling death and thinning of plant stand. - M. spp (other than M. nivale) cause a range of symptoms including brown lesions on stem bases, often restricted to outer leaf sheath. - Fusarium lesions often begin in the leaf sheath at the stem base where crown roots split the leaf sheath when emerging. - This infection can spread up the leaf sheath causing long dark brown streaks at the stem base. The other symptom in cooler regions is brown staining of lower nodes. - In older plants, fusarium infection can produce a true foot rot, where the stem base becomes brown and rotten, resulting in lodging and white heads. - Symptoms are prevalent in very dry seasons as well. - Ear blight causing fungus: F culmorum and F graminearum are common. Other are, F avenaceum, F poae and F langsethiae. - Infection frequently results in the whole or part of the ear becoming bleached. - Symptoms seen when ears become infected during the early flowering stages, later infection may result in infection of grain but without obvious bleaching of the ears. - Important due to its mycotoxin that gets accumulated in grains. Life cycle: - Most important source is seed but fungus survives on debris in soil also. - Spores are splashed in canopy causing ear blights and seed borne infection, in wet seasons, especially during flowering and grain formation. - Most fusarium species have competative saprophytic abilities which allow them to colonize debris and stubble in soil. Importance: - When wet season coincides with flowering high levels of ear blight can occur. - Due to seed borne nature of pathogen, seed treatment plays role in preventing seedling loss in wheat. 7.3.3 Major diseases of rice Blast Bavistin, Dorosal 2-3 g per kg seed treatment Tricyclazole 75% WP 0.75 g per ltr spray at 15 days interval Kasugamycin 3% SL 1.5 ml per ltr at 15 days interval Bacterial leaf blight Use Agromycin-100 0.25 g per ltr for seed soaking for 30 minutes Brown leaf spot disease Bavistin, Dorosal Apply Mancozeb 75% WP (Dithane M-45) 3 g per ltr water, Propineb 70% WP 3 g per ltr water at 15 days interval for 3 times.

Pests may be target insects, vegetation, fungi, etc. Most control the pests by poisoning them. Unfortunately, pesticides can be poisonous to humans as well. Toxicity: The toxicity of a substance is its capacity to cause injury to a living system. A living system can be things such as a human body, parts of the body (lungs or respiratory system), a pond, a forest and those creatures that live in there. Toxicity represents the kind and extent of damange that can be done by chemical. In other words, if you know the toxicity of a pesticide, you know how poisonous it is. Dose-time relationship of pesticide toxicity Dose is the quantity of a substance that a surface, plant or animal is exposed to. Time means how often the exposure occurs. This relationship gives rise to two types of toxicity. Acute toxicity: This refers to how poisonous a pesticide is to a human, animal or plant after a single-term exposure. It generally implies the effect that occurs within 24 hours of exposure. Chronic toxicity: This refers to delayed poisonous effects from exposure to substance. Routes of entry: Local: local effect refers to those that take place at the site of contact with material. e.g. skin irritation/inflammation on th hand in response to hand contact, irritation of mucous membrane lining the lungs due to inhalation of toxic fumes. Systemic: Effect that occur away from the original point of contact. These pesticides are distributed throughout the body once they enter. They function by blocking or stimulating a chemical signal, generally that of the nervous system (Cholinesterase). Pesticides may have following actions: Additive, antagonistic or synergistic Immediate or delayed Reversible or irreversible action Exposure may result in following effects: Reproductive effects Teratogenic effects: Effect on unborn offspring, such a birth defects. Carcinogenic effects: Cancer in living animal tissues. Oncogenic effects: Tumor forming effect (not necessarliy cancerous) Mutagenic effects: Permanent effect on genetic material that can be inherited Neurotoxicity: Poisoning of nervous system, including the brains. Immunosupression Acute toxicity measures To figure out how acutely toxic a pesticide is, scientists give laboratory animals short-exposure to does of pesticide being tested. Experimental doses are given orally, as well as put on eyes, skin, and in the air that test animals breathe. These animals are then carefully observed for the changes. LD50 Amount of a pesticide that has killed half of the animals in a laboratory test. LD50 values are effective for both oral and dermal routes of exposure. But they do not tell us about how the chemical acts, nor about how sensitive different organs within an animal or human might be. LD50 for different chemicals can be compared if the same test animial was used. The LD50 values are measured in unit of weight called mg per kg (or interchangeably, parts per million). LC50 This measure of toxicity gives the acute inhalation toxicity. Chronic toxicity measures There is no standard measure like LD50 for chronic toxicity studies. Often the length of the experiment is in days, months or years and the amount of each dose is stated. For e.g., a study of chronic oral toxicity might look like, “8 mg of pesticide to rats daily for two years. No symptoms of poisoning appeared.” Two classes of pesticides, organophosphates and carbamates can slowly poison by attacking an essential body chemical called “cholinesterase”. The chronic exposure to Organophosphate pesticides can be measured by monitoring changes in blood cholinesterase levels.

In the 2016 edition of its World Development Indicators, the World Bank made a decision to no longer distinguish between “developed” and “developing” countries in the presentation of its data, considering the two-category distinction outdated. Instead, the World Bank classifies countries into four groups, based on Gross National Income per capita, re-set each year on July 1. In 2016, the four categories in US dollars were: Low income countries: $995 or less Lower middle income countries: $996 to $3,895 Upper middle income countries: $3,895 to $12,055 High income countries: $12,056 and above Third world: Over the past few decades since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the term Third World has been used interchangeably with developing countries, but the concept has become outdated in recent years as it no longer represents the current political or economic state of the world. The three-world model arose during the Cold War to define countries aligned with NATO (the First World), the Communist Bloc (the Second World, although this term was less used), or neither (the Third World). Strictly speaking, “Third World” was a political, rather than an economic, grouping.

India and china are among the greatest emitters of greenhouse gases and consumers of fossil fuel, and it is predicted that their consumption of coal as major source of energy will continue to rise for at least a decade (IEA, 2019). - Into 2016 and we still have 80% of our total energy requirement met from fossil fuels (mostly, oil, coal and natural gases). International energy agency’s report says that 30% of all energy-related carbon dioxide emission is related to coal as fuel, making it the biggest single contributor (2019). - An individual effort to parsimoniously treat energy resources available to us determines individual footprint. We could choose to reuse a battery/cell, with minor power drops, in alternative electronic items compatible with it or just treat at a refuse at our home. The latter activity with unforeseen consequences might lead to the battery being disposed improperly and polluting an ecosystem due the leakage of its electrolyte chemicals. - While electricity is lighting up most houses, its generation has been a markedly different process worldwide. The process basically depends with the resource endowment of a nation in their approach to choosing ways to explore it. Coal, for example, is used largely in China and the US despite its much tauted big contribution in greenhouse emission. 9.2 UN related UN was established in October 24, 1945.

The convention documented the following: Agenda 21 (a non-binding action plan of the UN promoting sustainable development), The statement of Forest Principles, The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development Following conventions were formed: UNFCCC, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change CBD, Convention on Biological Diversity UNCCD, UN Convention to Combat Desertification 10.2 The CBD With 196 ratified parties, the CBD aims to conserve and protect biodiversity, biological resources and safeguard life on Earth, as an integral part of economic and social development. Considering biological diversity as a global asset to current and future generations and populations across the planet, the Convention works to prevent species extinction and maintain protected habitats. As well, the CBD promotes the sustainable use of components of biological diversity, and works to maintain the environmental and sustainable process of access and benefit sharing, derived from genetic resource use. The convention was established on December 29th, 1993. It has following objectives: 1. The conservation of biological diversity 2. The sustainable use of components of biological diversity 3. The fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The CBD currently follows the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, used as a vehicle to maintain synergies at National levels. Its mission is to \"take effective and urgent action to halt the loss of biodiversity to ensure that by 2020, ecosystems are resilient and continue to provide essential services, thereby securing the planet’s variety of life, and contributing to human well-being, and poverty eradication. 10.3 The UNFCCC With 197 ratified parties, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is committed to the objective of “[stabilizing] greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.” Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and previously the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the UNFCCC Secretariat works to maintain the goals and objectives of the Convention, as the primary United Nations body whose role functions to address the threat of climate change. The Paris Agreement, 2015: 10.4 The UNCCD An international agreement that ties the sustainability of land management and the issues of land degradation to the environment. Among the areas of consideration, the Convention focuses on restoring degraded ecosystems found in dryland areas. The UNCCD, consisting of 197 parties works towards creating ‘a future that avoids, minimizes, and reverses desertification/land degradation and mitigates the effects of drought in affected areas at all levels.’ Legislatively, the UNCCD is committed to achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) and combat pressing environmental issues of Desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD) through a newly created 2018-2030 Strategic Framework, consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This framework follows the 10-year strategic plan and framework for 2008-2018 that aimed to establish global partnerships in working toward the reversal and prevention of desertification and land degradation. The UNCCD aims to restore the productivity of degraded land, while improving livelihoods and aiding populations that are vulnerable because of environmental destruction. “The Convention’s 197 parties work together to improve the living conditions for people in drylands, to maintain and restore land and soil productivity, and to mitigate the effects of drought.” 10.5 Rio +20 Summit (Rio Earth Summit, 2012; June 13th-June 22nd) The issues addressed included: -1. systematic scrutiny of patterns of production — particularly the production of toxic components, such as lead in gasoline, or poisonous waste including radioactive chemicals -2. alternative sources of energy to replace the use of fossil fuels which delegates linked to global climate change -3. new reliance on public transportation systems in order to reduce vehicle emissions, congestion in cities and the health problems caused by polluted air and smoke -4. the growing usage and limited supply of water - UNFCCC led to Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. 10.6 Nagoya Protocol The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity, also known as the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) is a 2010 supplementary agreement to the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Its aim is the implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. However, there are concerns that the added bureaucracy and legislation will, overall, be damaging to the monitoring and collection of biodiversity, to conservation, to the international response to infectious diseases, and to research. The protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan, and entered into force on 12 October 2014. It has been ratified by 114 parties, which includes 113 UN member states and the European Union. It is the second protocol to the CBD; the first is the 2000 Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The Nagoya protocol applies to genetic resources that are covered by the CBD, and to the benefits arising from their utilization. The Nagoya Protocol sets out obligations for its contracting parties to take measures in relation to access to genetic resources, benefit-sharing and compliance. Implementation of the protocol deals with follwing major points: The Nagoya Protocol’s success will require effective implementation at the domestic level. A range of tools and mechanisms provided by the Nagoya Protocol will assist contracting parties including: Establishing national focal points (NFPs) and competent national authorities (CNAs) to serve as contact points for information, grant access, or cooperate on issues of compliance An Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House to share information, such as domestic regulatory ABS requirements or information on NFPs and CNAs Capacity-building to support key aspects of implementation. 10.7 The Ramsar Convention Abbreviated form for “The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat”; a.k.a. Convention on Wetlands) It is an international treaty for conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. It is named after the city of Ramsar, Iran where convention was signed in 1971. Every three years, representatives of the Contracting Parties meet as the conference of the Contracting Parties (COP), the policy-making organ of the Convention which adopts decisions (Resolutions and Recommendations) to administer the work of the Convention and improve the way in which the Parties are able to implement its objectives. COP12 was held in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in 2015. COP13 was held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in October 2018. List of Wetlands of International Importance include 2331 Ramsar sites in May 2018 covering over 2.1 million sqkm. The country with highest number of Sites is the UK with 170, and the country with the greatest area of listed wetlands is Bolivia, with over 140, 000 sqkm. The Ramsar Convention works closely with six other organisations known as International Organization Partners (IOPs). These are: - Birdlife International - International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) - International Water Management Institute (IWMI) - Wetlands International - WWF International - Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust (WWT) These organizations support the work of the Convention by providing expert technical advice, helping implement field studies, and providing financial support. The IOPs also participate regularly as observers in all meetings of the Conference of the Parties and as full members of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel. Following bodies are established by the Convention: 1. Conference of contracting parties (COP), 2. The Standing Committee, 3. The Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP), 4. The Secretariat. The secretariat is based at the headquarters of the IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. Martha Rojas Urrego is the sixth secretary of the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. The 2nd of February each year is World Wetlands Day, marking the date of the adoption of the Convention on Wetlands on 2 February 1971. WWD was celebrated for the first time in 1997 and has grown remarkably since then. In 2015 World Wetlands Day was celebrated in 59 countries. 10.8 Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity Drafted: 29 Jan, 2000; Signed: 15 May, 2000; Location: Montreal, Quebec; Effective: 11 September, 2003; Signatories 103; Parties: 171; Depositary: Secretary-General of the United Nations – Record retrieved: September, 2019 It is supplement to the Convention on Biological Diversity effective since 2003. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology. The Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the precautionary principle and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will for example let countries ban imports of genetically modified organisms if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence that the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically altered commodities such as corn or cotton. The required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003. As of February 2018, the Protocol had 171 parties, which includes 168 United Nations member states, the State of Palestine, Niue, and the European Union. The precautionary approach is contained in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. The main features of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety are: 1. Promotes biosafety by establishing rules and procedures for the safe transfer, handling, and use of LMOs, with specific focus on transboundary movements of LMOs. 2. It features a set of procedures including one for LMOs that are to be intentionally introduced into the environment called the advance informed agreement procedure (AIA), and one for LMOs that are intended to be used directly as food or feed or for processing. 3. Parties to the Protocol must ensure that LMOs are handled, packaged and transported under conditions of safety. 4. The shipment of LMOs subject to transboundary movement must be accompanied by appropriate documentation specifying, among other things, identity of LMOs and contact point for further information. These procedures and requirements are designed to provide importing Parties with the necessary information needed for making informed decisions about whether or not to accept LMO imports and for handling them in a safe manner. The Party of import makes its decisions in accordance with scientifically sound risk assessments. The Protocol sets out principles and methodologies on how to conduct a risk assessment. In case of insufficient relevant scientific information and knowledge, the Party of import may use precaution in making their decisions on import. Parties may also take into account, consistent with their international obligations, socio-economic considerations in reaching decisions on import of LMOs. Parties must also adopt measures for managing any risks identified by the risk assessment, and they must take necessary steps in the event of accidental release of LMOs. To facilitate its implementation, the Protocol establishes a Biosafety Clearing-House for Parties to exchange information, and contains a number of important provisions, including capacity-building, a financial mechanism, compliance procedures, and requirements for public awareness and participation. (Article 20 of the Protocol, SCBD 2000). The Biosafety Clearing-House was established in a phased manner, and the first meeting of the Parties approved the transition from the pilot phase to the fully operational phase, and adopted modalities for its operations (Decision BS-I/3, SCBD 2004). 10.9 The Kyoto Protocol Signed: 11 December, 1997; Location: Kyoto, Japan; Effective: 16 February, 2005, Condition: Ratificaiton by at least 55 states to the convention; Expiration: In force (first commitment period expired 31 December, 2012; Signatories: 84; Parties: 192) This Protocol extends the 1992 UNFCCC that commits state parties to reduce GHG emissions, based on the scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and it extremely likely that human-made CO2 emissions have predominantly caused it. The Kyoto Protocol applies to the six greenhouse gases listed in Annex A: Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O), Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Canada withdrew from the Protocol in December, 2012. The protocol’s second commitment period was agreed in 2012, known as Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol, in which 37 countries have binding targets. As of September 2019, 132 states have accepted the Doha Amendment, while entry into force requires the acceptance of 144 states. Of the 37 countries with binding commitments, 7 have ratified. Negotiations were held in the framework of the yearly UNFCCC Climate Change Conferences on measures to be taken after the second commitment period ends in 2020. This resulted in the 2015 adoption of the Paris Agreement, which is a separate instrument under the UNFCCC rather than an amendment of the Kyoto Protocol. On 8 December 2012, at the end of the 2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference, an agreement was reached to extend the Protocol to 2020 and to set a date of 2015 for the development of a successor document, to be implemented from 2020. The outcome of the Doha talks has received a mixed response, with small island states critical of the overall package. The Kyoto second commitment period applies to about 11% of annual global emissions of greenhouse gases. Other results of the conference include a timetable for a global agreement to be adopted by 2015 which includes all countries. At the Doha meeting of the parties to the UNFCCC on 8 December 2012, the European Union chief climate negotiator, Artur Runge-Metzger, pledged to extend the treaty, binding on the 27 European Member States, up to the year 2020 pending an internal ratification procedure. Ban Ki Moon, Secretary General of the United Nations, called on world leaders to come to an agreement on halting global warming during the 69th Session of the UN General Assembly on 23 September 2014 in New York. UN member states have been negotiating a future climate deal over the last five years. A preliminary calendar was adopted to confirm “national contributions” to the reduction of CO2 emissions by 2015 before the UN climate summit which was held in Paris at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. 10.10 WTO The WTO agreements cover a wide range of activities such as agriculture, textiles and clothing, banking, telecommunications, government purchases, industrial standards and product safety, food and sanitation regulations and intellectual property. GATT is now the WTO’s principal rule-book for trade in goods. The Uruguay Round also created new rules for dealing with trade in services, relevant aspects of intellectual property, dispute settlement, and trade policy reviews. The complete set runs to some 30,000 pages consisting of about 30 agreements and separate commitments (called schedules) made by individual members in specific areas such as lower customs duty rates and services market-opening (WTO, 2008). Agreement related to Agriculture Sector in WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AOA) The AOA was the outcome of the Uruguay Round (UR) negotiations that started in 1986 and concluded in 1994. The long-term objectives set by the AOA are to establish a fair and market oriented agricultural trading system through substantial reductions in agricultural support and protection. AOA deals all the matters of tariff, domestic support and export subsidies. It is rightly identified that the root cause of distortion of international trade in agriculture is the massive domestic subsidies given by industrialized countries over the decades (WTO, 1995). In order to minimize such dumped exports and to keep their markets open for efficient agricultural producers of the world, the starting point has to be the reduction of the domestic production subsidies given by the industrialized countries, followed by reduction of export subsidies and the volume of subsidized exports, and minimum market access opportunity for foreign agricultural producers\". Domestic Support Domestic support provides commitments to reduce agricultural subsidies and other programmes including those raise or guarantee farm gate prices and farmers’ incomes. These supports are divided by the AOA into different boxes in tricky way. Implications of AOA Domestic measures to Nepal The agricultural businesses are linked to trade and hence to WTO in several ways. The agribusiness needs imported inputs, machineries and technology from abroad. The major inputs imported by Nepal are chemical fertilizers, pesticides, hormones, veterinary medicines, seeds and packaging materials. As the market is liberalized and imports are not restricted, the agribusiness also needs to compete in domestic markets with imported goods. Some agribusinesses generate exportable goods. The export can be done either under bilateral agreements (such as with India), regional agreements (like with Bangladesh and Pakistan) and multilateral agreements (like with the countries not involved in bilateral and regional agreements such as USA, European Union, Japan). All such activities of agribusiness like import of inputs, export of outputs and competition in domestic markets are affected Agreement on Agriculture (AOA), Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures, Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) primarily. Market Access Market access is one of the three main pillars of the AOA – the other two being domestic support measures and export competition. It deals with rules and commitments related to import of goods. Its purpose is to expand trade by preventing various non-tariff barriers and by binding and reducing tariffs. Besides tariffs, other trade policy instruments covered by the market access pillar include Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) and Special Safeguard (SSG) as a trade remedy measure (Sharma and Karki, 2004). In the WTO context, market access is about both obligations and rights. Nepal’s obligation is to provide market access to other Members in return for her right of access to others’ markets for Nepalese goods on multilaterally agreed terms. Thus, a balanced analysis of market access provisions would cover both obligations and rights. The AoA provisions on market access - Prohibition of quantitative restrictions on imports - Tariff binding and reduction - Bound versus applied tariffs - Tariff Rate Quota - Special Safeguard Measures - Export subsidies and export restrictions In common with all least developed countries (LDCs) and a majority of the developing countries, Nepal does not subsidize exports. At the time of the WTO accession, it committed not to subsidize exports in future also. One of the conclusions of the study is that this commitment is unlikely to have any negative implications for the Nepalese agriculture for two reasons. First, export subsidization is not a sound economic policy. Second, Nepal could not afford export subsidies at its low level of economic development. On the other hand, there were several instances in the past when export subsidization by other countries had some negative effects on the Nepalese agriculture. Therefore, it is in Nepal’s interest to tighten WTO rules on export subsidy (Tiwari et al, 2004). Implication on Nepalese Agriculture: - Nepal can promote exports through various incentive measures of the WTO Subsidies Agreement. - Limited implications of the WTO rules on export restriction and taxation policies. - Nepal is occasionally affected negatively by export subsidization by others - Domestic policy issues and analytical needs Sanitory and Phyto Sanitory (SPS) Food quality and safety issues have entered into a new era of evolution as it involves integrated effort linking production to consumption in the entire food chain. The traditional domain of inspecting and analysing the end product does not necessarily meet the requirement of emerging trade regime of WTO and related agreements such as the SPS. The main objectives of the SPS Agreement are the following (Karki et al, 2004). - Protect and improve the current human health, animal health, and phytosanitary situation of all Member countries; and - The entry, establishment or spread of pests, disease, disease-carrying organisms or disease-causing organisms; - Additives, contaminants, toxins or disease-causing organisms in foods, beverages or feedstuffs; - Carried by animals, plants or products thereof, or from the entry, establishment or spread of pests; or - Prevent or limit other damage within the territory of the Member from the entry, establishment or spread of pests. The following are the main elements of the SPS Agreement (Karki et al, 2004). 1. Harmonization 2. Equivalence 3. Risk assessment 4. Transparency 5. Consultation and dispute settlement: 6. Technical cooperation and Special and Differential Treatment The SPS Agreement and Trade In Live Animals and Animal Products The SPS Agreement recognizes the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) as the relevant international organisation responsible for the development and promotion of international animal health standards, guidelines, and recommendations affecting trade in live animals and animal products. Similarly, the official (Public) Veterinary Services of a country are recognized as the relevant authority with ultimate responsibility for animal health matters involving international trade in live animals and animal products. The OIE provides detailed Guidelines for the Evaluation of Veterinary Services (Chapter 1.3.4. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code). According to these guidelines, the national Veterinary Services should be able to demonstrate capacity, supported by appropriate legislation, in the following areas (Mahato et al, 2004). - Exercise control over all animal health matters - Prescribe methods for control and to exercise systematic control over the import and export processes of animals and animal products in so far as this control relates to sanitary and zoo-sanitary matters. - Control imports and transit of animals, animal products and other materials that may introduce animal diseases. - Present a functional animal disease reporting system which covers all regions of the country - Provide accurate and valid certification for exports of animals and animal products. The SPS Agreement: Trade in Plants and Plant Products With increasing trade in plant and plant products, the risk of the spread of harmful pests and diseases has also increased. The negative impact on plant health and plant products could be substantial, e.g. an imported harmful pest could destroy entire orange production in a country or a region, or could result into reduced yield, quality deterioration and environmental pollution. In the case of Nepal, export and import of agricultural and forest-based products through the long and porous borders had been taking place almost without any phytosanitary considerations until recently. To a large extent the practice continues even now. As the potential negative effects are being increasingly recognized and as WTO Members started to implement the SPS Agreement since 1995 the situation is changing. Nepal also had its share of the deleterious effects of the harmful pests that came with imported plants and the difficulties in exporting plants and products, particularly to India in recent years. In view of this, and her commitment to implement provisions of the SPS agreement by 1 January 2007 timely action in this direction has become necessary ( KC et al, 2004). Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) establishes disciplines on technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures for agricultural and well as non-agricultural products. Technical regulations and standards deal with product characteristics, processes and production methods related to a product, and may also bear upon terminology, symbols, packaging, marking or labelling. Conformity assessment procedures, such as testing, inspection, evaluation and approval, are employed to determine compliance with technical regulations and standards. The TBT agreement encourages members to give positive consideration to accepting as equivalent technical regulations of other members, even if those regulations differ from their own, provided they are satisfied that these regulations adequately fulfil the objectives of their own regulations. Under this provision, members retain the discretion to determine whether equivalence will adequately satisfy their legitimate regulatory objectives. This will lead to smoother trade of goods produced by the agribusiness as well (Pant, 2004). Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) protects and enforces the rights of inventors. Its main objectives are promoting, transferring and disseminating the technological innovations for the advantages of both producers and users. In agriculture sector, it includes definition of specific genes and modifications of genes. Such genes modified organisms are commonly called genetically modified organisms (GMO). The major concern in TRIPS concerning to agriculture is the exploitation of plant genetic resources and claiming rights for gene spliced plants and animals. Therefore, seed related the TRIPS would affect businesses and seed using businesses in one or the other way (Pant, 2007). Lastly, the TRIPS agreement provides that geographical indications, hitherto used for alcoholic products, can be used in agribusiness as well. This will be helpful to create and protect agricultural products having geographical reputations like Ilam tea, Sindhuli junar, Marpha apple, Nepal honey, etc. Such reputations of the names of the place will be protected by the law and produce of other geographic areas and foreign countries cannot use such indications. General Agreement on Trade in services (GAT) This Agreement opens the door for foreign investment in different sectors while accessing the membership of WTO by Nepal, had agreed on 74 different sectors and sub-sectors for trade out of which only 2 sectors are related to agriculture. They include 1. Animal medical services 2. Technical Experiment and investigation services WTO and Emerging Issues in Nepalese Agriculture Keeping eyes on the benefits that can arise from the agreements of WTO, we need to address major issues in agricultural sector. The issues at hand include scale sensitivity, trade restriction at disguise, resource mobility and technology transfer (Pant, 2004 &amp; 2007). Scale Sensitivity of WTO Provisions It is usually believed that the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AOA) does not focus on addressing the development needs and concerns of the small-scale subsistence farmers in developing countries. It rather tends to emphasize on commercial agriculture and trade. For example, rules under WTO say that the fees and charges on the services from the public sector should match the amount of the service provided and not be based on the volume of transactions. Disguised Protection in the Name of Quality Standard The AOA commits reductions in protection measures and trade distorting subsidies. The experience shows that the agricultural trade has become more protected in the developed countries after the establishment of WTO. In Nepal the agriculture is exposed to market forces in the name of economic liberalization. Competitiveness The major problem in international competition is our small scale and high cost of production. Low technology production makes our product less competitive in terms of quality. In addition, our trading partners may prevent entry of our products in the name of protecting animal, plant and human health and life in their country. We have competitiveness in the products with low capital and high labour inputs. Some of such products are, for example, hybrid vegetable seeds, flower seeds, medicinal herbs, silk, honey, dry fruits and cottage cheese. Labour Mobility Nepal’s agriculture sector is labour surplus. As the surplus labour comes out of it, farms will experience labour shortage. This will have two effects. First, wage rate in the farm will increase. That will not only make agriculture workers better of but also make technological interventions like mechanization financially viable to adopt. Second, some farms will not be able to afford for higher wage or mechanization. Such financially non-viable farms need to go for enterprise transformation for increasing productivity. This will increase the efficiency of the farm sector. Land Mobility There are two issues in land mobility. First, moving land from low productive enterprises to high productive enterprises is experienced for centuries. The speed is gaining in recent years. Some examples of such movements of land (generally referred as change in cropping pattern) are as follows. - maize/millet farming upland is getting shifted to summer vegetables, ginger and cardamom - fallow lands during winter is moved to winter vegetables - pasture lands in hills are shifter to tea, coffee and fruits Technology Transfer in Agribusiness The TRIPS measure is expected to accelerate the pace of generation of agricultural technology. However, the royalty rights of the inventors will make the technology costlier to the users. On the other hand, the agribusiness can make better choice of technology for adoption and it will increase the productive efficiency and net gain of the agribusiness. Increase in the price of agricultural products due to reduction in the farm subsidies in developed countries will increase the demand of agricultural products from developing countries and is expected to facilitate investment in agriculture in LDCs. It ultimately will help in the modernization of agriculture sector. Service Sector Openings Nepal has opened some services to foreign investment with some conditions like compulsory incorporation of certain portion of equity to domestic investors, and employment of local staff except a certain fraction of high level experts and managers. Among the services opened, those directly concerned with the agribusiness are (a) veterinary services, (b) research and development services and (c) technical testing and analysis services. Opening of these services is expected to attract foreign direct investment in such agribusiness. In addition, availability of the better services will help domestic agribusinesses to expand. It will also help promote the product quality for export. Effects of Policy Changes Abroad Reductions in the domestic and export subsidies on agriculture in developed and developing counties is expected to increase the international prices of food items. In fact the increase in food prices will encourage the private investment in agricultural sector to increase its productivity. Conclusions The major provisions of WTO relating to the agribusiness are in the Agreement on Agriculture, SPS/TBT agreements and TRIPS agreements. Other agreements of WTO affect the agribusiness indirectly. Several provisions of these agreements can be used to support agricultural production, marketing and trade. For this purpose, we need to revise our domestic policies in standards setting and certification, increasing the production scale and making our resources mobile. Nepal is concerned with the food security and safeguarding rural employment, for which we need some flexibility under the provisions for domestic support. We are also questioning the extremely high subsidies and tariff walls even now being maintained by the developed countries, although they are committed to reduction of both under the Uruguay round. We are seeking better market access for our agricultural products for integration to multilateral trading system. Because of the large dependency on agriculture for employment, even minor changes in agricultural employment opportunities, commonly prices or trade conditions can have major socio-economic ramifications in Nepal. To comply with the principles of WTO without compromising our development needs and livelihood of the farmers we need some additional facilities like - Maximum improvement of opportunities and terms of access (like duty free quota free access to the markets in developed countries) for agricultural products of our production potential - Meaningful and practical special and differential treatment to LDCs to enable them to take appropriate domestic policy measures to address growth and development needs in agriculture; and - In the meantime, it is absolutely necessary to protect the resource poor subsistence farmers from surges of cheap subsidized imports. 10.11 Trade agreements The Nagoya protocol relates to Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs), which include provisions relating to access to genetic resources or to the sharing of the benefits that arise out of their utilization. - PTA is a trading bloc that gives preferential access to certain products from the participating countries. This is done by reducing tariff but not by abolishing them completely. A PTA can be established through a trade pact. It is the first stage of economic integration. The line between a PTA and a FTA may be blurred, as almost any PTA has a main goal of becoming a FTA in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. - These tariff preference have created numerous departures from the normal trade relations principle, that WTO members should apply the same tariff to imports from other WTO members. - With the recent multiplication of bilateral PTAs and the emergence of Mega-PTAs (wide regional trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership; TTIP) or Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)), a global trade system exclusively managed within the framework of the WTO now seems unrealistic and the interactions between trade systems have to be taken into account. The increased complexity of the international trade system generated by the multiplication of PTAs should be taken into account in the study of the choice of for a used by countries or regions to promote their trade relations and environmental agenda. A free trade area is basically a preferential trade area with increased depth and scope of tariffs reduction. All free trade areas, customs unions, common markets, economic unions, customs and monetary unions and economic and monetary unions are considered advanced forms of a PTA, but these are not listed below. Multilateral Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) (1992) Generalized System of Preferences Global System of Trade Preferences among Developing Countries (GSTP) (1989) Latin American Integration Association (LAIA/ALADI) (1981)[3] Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) (1994) Protocol on Trade Negotiations (PTN) (1973) South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA) (1981)[4] Bilateral Several hundred bilateral PTAs have been signed since the early 20th century. The TREND project of the Canada Research Chair in International Political Economy lists around 700 trade agreements, the vast majority of which are bilateral. - European Union – ACP countries, formerly via the trade aspects of the Cotonou Agreement, later via Everything But Arms (EBA) agreements - India – Afghanistan (2003) - India – Mauritius - India – Nepal (2009) - India – Chile (2007) - India – MERCOSUR (2009) - ASEAN – PR China (2005) - Laos – Thailand (1991) 10.12 Most favoured nation (MFN) It is a status or level of treatment accorded by one state to another in international trade. The term means the country which is the recipient of this treatment must nominally receive equal trade advantages as the “most favoured nation” by the country granting such treatment (trade advantages include low tariffs or high import quotas). In effect, a country that has been accorded MFN status may not be treated less advantageously than any other country with MFN status by the promising country. There is a debate in legal circles whether MFN clauses in bilateral investment treaties include only substantive rules or also procedural protections. The members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agree to accord MFN status to each other. Exceptions allow for preferential treatment of developing countries, regional free trade areas and customs unions. Trade experts consider MFN clauses to have the following benefits: - Increases trade creation and decreases trade diversion. A country that grants MFN on imports will have its imports provided by the most efficient supplier if the most efficient supplier is within the group of MFN. Otherwise, that is, if the most efficient producer is outside the group of MFN and additionally, is charged higher rates of tariffs, then it is possible that trade would merely be diverted from this most efficient producer to a less efficient producer within the group of MFN (or with a tariff rate of 0). This leads to economic costs for the importing country, which can outweigh the gains from free trade. - MFN allows smaller countries, in particular, to participate in the advantages that larger countries often grant to each other, whereas on their own, smaller countries would often not be powerful enough to negotiate such advantages by themselves. - Granting MFN has domestic benefits: having one set of tariffs for all countries simplifies the rules and makes them more transparent. Theoretically, if all countries in the world confer MFN status to each other, there will be no need to establish complex and administratively costly rules of origin to determine which country a product (that may contain parts from all over the world) must be attributed to for customs purposes. However, if at least one nation lies outside the MFN alliance, then customs cannot be done away with. - MFN restrains domestic special interests from obtaining protectionist measures. For example, butter producers in country A may not be able to lobby for high tariffs on butter to prevent cheap imports from developing country B, because, as the higher tariffs would apply to every country, the interests of A’s principal ally C might get impaired. - As MFN clauses promote non-discrimination among countries, they also tend to promote the objective of free trade in general. MFN: A case of India As per the obligation under the World Trade Organization (WTO), the member countries of WTO shall extend Most Favored Nation (MFN) status to each other automatically, unless otherwise specified in the agreement or schedule notified to the WTO by the member country. Pursuant to this Provision, in case of goods, India has extended MFN status to member countries of WTO. As regards SAARC countries, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are members of WTO and except the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, these countries have extended MFN status to India. India has extended MFN status to all these SAARC countries including Pakistan. So far as exception to MFN status, if any, in services is concerned, each member country has indicated the same in the schedule of commitments in services notified to WTO. The mfn status was finally withdrawn for pakistan on 15 February 2019 in response to the Pulwama attack. "],

The guidelines have presented the pocket package program under two categories namely Crop production and Livestock production. Agriculture fair is based on the concept of “Seeing is believing”. Department of Agriculture first broadcasted improved production technology in agriculture through radio for the first time in 2016 B.S. Agriculture program broadcast over radio was stopped for a few years and later resumed back in 2023 Mangsir 20. In group approach of extension is used in convincing a farmer to use a technology when s/he has been made aware of it through mass media approach. 11.2 Periodic planning The nineth plan considered poverty reduction and other development goals. The main target of this plan was to reduce the headcount poverty in the headcount poverty index from as high as 42% to 32%, 23%, 15% and 10 by 2002, 2007, 2012 and 2017, respectively. However, it could not be realized as the poverty rate in 2011 was 25%. The tenth plan (2002-2007) is considered as a comprehensive plan designed for the reduction of poverty to a desired level. Designed as the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), the tenth plan incorporated the involvement of the private sector in the market economy with the facilitation from the government side. Because of the bad political situation and existing conflict inside the country, reduction of poverty was a daunting task and this was reflected in the level of poverty that country was facing by the end of this plan. Instead of eleventh plan, interim plan for 3 years was launched from 2007/08-2009/10. The main objective of this plan was to generate an experience of a direct feeling of change in the lives of the general public by supporting in the establishment of peace and reducing the existing unemployment, poverty and inequality. This plan was designed in a critical state of transition where the country was formulating a new constitution to restore peace and reconstruction and reintegration among people suffering from the conflict. The twelve three year plans (2010/11-2012/13) has kept poverty alleviation as its major agenda and inclusive employment generation and equitable economic growth are considered two important pillars for realizing poverty alleviation. The purpose of this plan is to incorporate every community from all around the country to make sure that every underprivilaged and marginalized group is included. This plan has mobilized volunteers through National Development Volunteer Services (NDVS). NDVS has been implemented by district development committees. The purpose of this program is to mobilize volunteers as moderators in disadvantaged communities such as poor, ethnic, Dalit communities so that they will help them as facilitator in education, health, infrastructure, social mobilization and other areas. 11.3 National tea policy, 2000 GoN approved and implemented National Tea Policy, 2000 as per intention of National Tea and Coffee Development Board Act, 1992 for: Income generation (enhancing employment, earning foreign currency) Participation in private sector in production, processing and commercial transaction through systematic and sustainable utilization of resources in country.
