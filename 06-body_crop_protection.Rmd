## Historical outbreaks of diseases

**Irish famine**

In about 1800, the potato, which was introduced in Europe from south and central america around 1570 AD was a well established crop in Ireland. After strong objections against adopting it because (1) it was new and not mentioned in the Bible, (2) it was produced in the ground and, therefore, was unclean, and (3) because parts of it were poisonous, the potato was nevertheless adopted and its cultivation spread rapidly. Adoption of potato cultivation came as a result of it producing much more edible food per unit of land than grain crops, mostly wheat and rye, grown until then.

Irish farmers grew potato well for many years, free of any serious problems. In the early 1840s, potato crops began to fail to variying extents in several areas of Europe and Ireland. Most of the growing season of 1845 in Ireland was quite favorable for the growth of potato plants and for the formation of tubers.
 
Around 8 million people suffer from famine due to late blight of Potato by _Phytophthora infestans_. About 1.5 million people died of hunger and many emigrate to other countries, mostly North America.

**Ceylon srilanks**

Rust was first reported in the major coffee growing regions of Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) in 1867. The causal fungus was first fully described by the English mycologist Michael Joseph Berkeley and his collaborator Christopher Edmund Broome after an analysis of specimens of a “coffee leaf disease” collected by George H.K. Thwaites in Ceylon. Berkeley and Broome named the _Hemileia vastatrix_ (Pucciniales, Basidiomycota), "Hemileia" referring to the half smooth characteristic of the spores and "vastatrix" for the devastating nature of the disease. Farmers completely burned down the orchard and restarted the cultivation.

**Downy mildew of grapes**

Class: Oomycota
Order: Peronosporales

_Plasmopara viticola_, also known as grape downy mildew, is considered to be the most devastating disease of grapevines in climates with relatively warm and humid summers. It was first observed in 1834 by Schweinitz on Vitis aestivalis in the southeastern United States. France was among the first of the European countries to gain experience in dealing with the pathogen. Within just a few years of the pathogen's introduction the French attempted to graft American root stock to their own vines in order to produce a more resistant strain of grape. Depending on the year, production of grapes in France has been estimated to have been reduced by as much as 50%.

**Bengal famine of 1943**

The Bengal famine stroke Bengal province of British India during World war II. An estimated 2.1-3 million, out of a population of 60.3 million, died of starvation, malaria, or other diseases aggravated by malnutrition, population displacement and other causes. Affecting of winter rice with a severe outbreak of fungal brown spot disease ( _Helminthosporium oryzae_) is considered to have a major role in the exacerbation of famine besides, political and other causes, cyclone particularly.

## Disease pests

### Rust

**Management**

Macrocyclic disease: _Puccinia graminis_ is a macrocyclic heteroecious fungus that causes wheat stem rust disease. The repeating stage in this fungus occurs on wheat and not the alternate host, barberry. The repeating stage allows the disease to persist in wheat even though the alternate host may be removed. Planting resistant crops is the ideal form of disease prevention, however, mutations can give rise to new strains of fungi that can overcome plant resistance. Although the disease cannot be stopped by removal of the alternate host, the life cycle is disrupted and the rate of mutation is decreased because of reduced genetic recombination. This allows resistance bred crops to remain effective for a longer period of time.

Demicyclic Disease: Because there is no repeating stage in the life cycle of demicyclic fungi, removal of the primary or the alternate host will disrupt the disease cycle. This method, however, is not highly effective in managing all demicyclic diseases. Cedar-apple rust disease, for example, can persist despite removal of one of the hosts since spores can be disseminated from long distances. The severity of Cedar-apple rust disease can be managed by removal of basidiospore producing galls from junipers or the application of protective fungicides to junipers.

Sulphur powder is known to stop spore germination. Fungicides such as Mancozeb and Triforine may help but may never eradicate the disease.

**Common rust fungi in agriculture**

- _Hemileia vastatrix_ (Coffee rust); Primary host is coffee plant; unknown alternate host. Heteroecious
- _Phakopsora meibomiae_ and _P. pachyrhizi_ (Soybean rust); Primary host is soybean and various legumes. Unknown alternate host. Heteroecious
- _Puccinia coronata_ (Crown Rust of Oats and Ryegrass); Oats are the primary host; Rhamnus spp. (Buckthorn) is alternate host. Heteroecious and macrocyclic
- _Puccinia graminis_ (Stem rust of wheat and Kentucky bluegrass, or black rust of cereals); Primary hosts include: Kentucky bluegrass, barley, and wheat; Common barberry is the alternate host. Heteroecious and macrocyclic
- _Puccinia hemerocallidis_ (Daylily rust); Daylily is primary host; Patrina sp is alternate host. Heteroecious and macrocyclic
- _Puccinia triticina_ (Brown Wheat Rust) in grains
- _Puccinia sorghi_ (Common Rust of Corn)
- _Puccinia striiformis_ (Yellow Rust) of cereals
- _Uromyces appendiculatus_ (Bean Rust) in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)[16]
- _Puccinia melanocephala_ (Brown Rust of Sugarcane)
- _Puccinia kuehnii_ (Orange rust of Sugarcane)

**UG99**

It is a lineage of wheat stem rust ( _Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici_), which is present in wheat fields in several countries in Africa and Middle east and is predicted to spread rapidly through these regions and possibly further afield, potentially causing a wheat production disaster that would affect food security worldwide. It can cause up to 100% crop losses and is virulent against many resistance genes which have previously protected against stem rust.

### Citrus decline in Nepal

Citrus greening disease or HLB was first reported from China in 1919 by Reinking while evaluating diseases of economic plants in southern China and used English term “yellow shoot” of citrus in the report. At that time it was believed that the HLB was caused by abiotic factors like Zn deficiency/toxicity and poor drainage system. By 1967, it became established that greening was graft and insect transmissible with conclusion caused by virus (Bove 2006). In 1967, mycoplasm like organisms (MLOs) were believed to be associated with plant diseases mostly with "yellow" symptoms resembling with greening symptoms. On close examination, these organisms were seen to have bacterial cell wall in addition to cytoplasmic membrane, suggesting that they were gram negative true bacteria (Garnier and Bove 1977). Thus, it was concluded that the HLB agent was gram negative bacterium -- _Liberobacter asiaticus_.

Citrus decline was reported for the first time in Pokhara valley by Thrower (1968) in Nepal. Based on visual observation, Knorr et al (1970) suspected that the decline was caused by greening disease entered with the planting materials introduced to Horticulture Research Station, Pokhara from Saharanpur, India. About 55% of citrus trees in Pokhara valley and 100% in Horticulture Research Station were symptomatic to HLB in 1980s (Regmi 1982).

More recent PCR test showed that HLB is widespread in many citrus pockets of Kaski, Syanja, Tanahu, Lamjung and Dhading districts (Bove 2006 Regmi and Yadav 2007 Regmi et al 2010).

**Diagnosis of Citrus decline**

Visual symptoms are apparent on leaves and fruits. A tree infected with HLB in the field usually develops one or more yellow shoots with other parts of the tree healthy or symptomless. The affected leaves develop a pattern of yellow and green areas lacking clear limits between the colors, giving a "blotchy mottle" appearance. This is the most characteristic foliar symptom and the patterns are asymmetrical on the two halves of the leaf (Bove 2006). Leaves can also become thicker, with veins enlarged and corky in appearance. In later stages, Zn deficiency-like symptoms can be seen followed by leaf drop and twig dieback.

Currently, other methods besides visual diagnosis of Huanglongbang are molecular marker based test (quantative PCR), biological indexing, iodine test and spectroscopy. Based on severity of HLB symptoms and the ability to continue growth of the plants inoculation with _Ca._ L. _asiaticus_ Folimonova et al (2009) grouped citrus genotypes into four categories as 
i. sensitive: C. halimii, Nules clementine mandarin, Minneola tangelo, sweet oranges and grapefruit
ii. moderately tolerant: Sun Chu Sha mandarin, sour orange, volkamer lemon, C. macrophylla, wingle citrumelo, citron, Palestine sweet lime, acid lime, calamondin, and C. micrantha
iii. tolerant: Eureka lemon, Persian lime, Carrizo citrange, and Severinia buxifolia 
iv. variable (some branch sensitive and some branch tolerant): pummelos, C. amblycarpa, cleopatra mandarin, C. indica, and meiwa kumquat.

**Citrus greening control**

- Inoculum reduction and vector control: Planting of certified clean planting materials, effective control of its vector psyllid populations and removal of infected trees that serve as an inoculums source for psyllid acquisition are the methods of choice. Biological control of the psyllid vector is only possible in locations that do not favour build-up of psyllid populations and is often compromised when hyper-parasites are present.

- Chemical control: Combination of penicillin and streptomycin (PS) was effective in eliminating or supressing the bacterium.

- Nutrition: Preliminary results of the research showed that HLB-infected trees are consistently deficient in Ca, Mg, Mn, Zn and B, and in an orchard. The main cause of visible HLB symptoms, yield reduction, and tree decline appears to be disruption of phloem tissue, which blocks the flow of photosynthate and nutrients from source to sink tissue. Hence plant growth enhancers, mainly that of root system should, to some extent, alleviate the symptoms of HLB.

- Use of tolerant rootstocks: The citrus rootstock US-897 ( _Citrus reticulata_ Blanco x _Poncirus trifoliata_ L. Raf.) was observed to be tolerant to HLB in field plantings.

- Guava intercropping: An observation in Vietnam in 2000, noted that the normal life of sole citrus plantings in Mekon region was 2 to 4 years, but those interplanted with white guava were surviving for up to 15 years (Gottwald et al 2010). Raising guava as an intercrop reduced psyllid population in citrus orchards.

### Guava wilt

Causative agent: _Fusarium oxysporium f. psidi_, _Rhizoctonia spp._

Guava plants are attacked by wilt causing pathogen, which alone causes heavy losses in Nepalese guava trees. Yellowing and browning of leaves from the twigs tip. Leaves die off causing cracking in the twigs and trunk leading to the complete wilting and decline of entire tree. The incidence is more severe in alkaline soil and during winter season.

**Control measures**

- It is better to remove such trees as soon as the symptoms are identified to prevent the spread of disease.
- Apply 15 gm of bavistin at the basin of each plant after pruning in March, June and September.
- Liming of the pits.
- Use of resistant root stock such as chinese guava and wilt resistant variety like Allahabad safeda, Banarasi, Nasik etc.

### Fruit rot of guava

Causative agent: _Phomopsis psidi_

This is a serious disease especially during rainy seasons. The symptoms are manifested as development of dark brown circular spots at the blossom end of the immature green fruits.

Control measures: Application of Zineb (0.2%) or aureofungin (10 ppm) as monthly sprays during June to October can control the disease. Apply Kavach/Rovral (2g/ltr) and Carbendazim (1 g/ltr) during rainy season.

### Fruit canker 

Causative agent: _Pestalotiopsis psidi_

Cankerous growth on fruit leading to cracking of fruits.

Control measures: Apply Dilhan 278 (2g), Cuman L (4 ml/ltr) and Rovral (2g/ltr) during rainy season.

## Pesticides

### History

- The oldest available record is Homer's mention (about 1000 BC) that Odysseus burned sulfur to purge the hall and the house and the court.
- In 1669, the earliest known record of arsenic as an insecticide in the western world mentioned its use with honey as an ant bait.
- Use of tobacco as contact insecticide was mentioned later in the same century.
- Copper compounds were known since 1807 to have fungicidal value, and the Bordeaux mixture (hydrated lime and copper sulfate) was first used in France in 1883.
- Hydrocyanic acid, known to the egyptians and the Romans as a poison, was used as a fumigant in 1877 to kill museum pests in insect collections.
- Carbon disulfide has been used as an insect fumigant since 1854.
- Mercury chloride was extensively used as fungicide since 1891, and was slowly replaced by its organic forms such as phenylmercury (1915), alkylxyalkylmercury (1920s).
- First synthetic organic insecticides that appeared for public use was probably dinitro compounds and thiocyanates (in early 1930s)
- These led to proliferation of new synthetic pesticides including DDT, organophosphates and pyrethroids.
- Paul Muller (awarded nobel prize in Medicine for his discoveries) in 1939 found dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) acted as a contact poison on flies, mosquitores, and other insects. In 1945, monsanto begins manufacturing 2,4-D.
- In 1949, case of human exposure to dioxin causing severe skin lesions was first documented.
- Organic sulfur fungicides such as captan, maneb and others were introduced in late 1950's, however some are known to have toxicological problems.
- In 1972 EPA banned DDT.
- In developing countries where the risk of contracting malaria is extremely high, DDT is permitted as a tool for mosquito population control. The benefit of suppressing the malaria-transmitting mosquitoes outweighs the risk of DDT exposure.
- Production of DDT in the USA peaked in the early 1960's and gradually declined. 
- In 1962 Rachel Carson published the book Silent Spring, an impassioned denouncement of the consequences of chemical contamination of the environment, with particular emphasis on the bioaccumulation of DDT and its effects on bird reproduction.
- Pyrethroids derive from molecules originally isolated from pyrethrum flowers which were used by Gaucasian tribes and in Persia since the early 1800's to control body lice. The flower extracts contain six closely related insecticidal esters, collectively referred to as the pyrethrins, whose main structures were elucidiated between 1910 and 1924.
- Some of the most commonly used pyrethroid insecticides, such as permethrin, cypermethrin, decamethrin and fenvalerate, were synthesized in the 1970s.

### Brief history of DDT

DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was developed as the first of the modern synthetic insecticides in the 1940s. It was intially used with great effect to combat malaria, typhus, and the other insect-borne human diseases among both military and civilian populations adn for insect control in crop and livestock production, institutions, homes and gardens. DDT's quick success as a pesticide and broad use in the US and other countries led to the develpment of resistance by many insect pest species. The US Department of Agriculture, the federal agency responsible for regulating pesticides before the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, began regulatory actions in the late 1950s and 1960s to prohibit many of DDT uses because of mounting evidence of the pesticide's declining benefits and environmental and toxicological effects. Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring in 1962 stimulated widespread public concern over the dangers of improper pesticide use and the need for better pesticide controls. DDT was firstly banned in 1972 by many European nations.

### Stockholm convention

The stockholm convention was brought about as a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The convention seeks the elimination or restriction of production and use of all intentionally produced POPs (i.e. industrial chemical pesticides), and the continuing minimization and, where feasible, ultimate elimination of releases of unintentionally produced POPs, such as dioxins and furans. Stockpiles must be managed and disposed off in a safe, efficient, environmentally sound manner. The convention was finalized at the 5th Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) Meeting in Johannesburg in December, 2000. The signing and adoption of the Stolkholm Convention took place in Stolkholm on 23 May 2001 with entry into force following on 17th May 2004 after the fiftieth ratification. Currently, 176 countries are parties to the Convention.

### On environmental perspective, pesticides are of following types, based on bio-degradation

1. Environmentally degradable/non-persistent:
  - Dimethoate (Nuger, Roger, Dimet)
  - Dichlorovos (Dum, Vapon)
  - Fenitrothion (Folithion)
  - Malathion
2. Environmentally non-degradable/persistent:
  - PoPs: Aldrin, chlordane, DDT, Dialdrin, Eldrin, Heptachlor, Mirex, Toxaphene, HCB, PCB, Dioxyn, Furan, etc.
  - These pesticides require special treatment facility for disposal.

## Pathogenic Nematodes

- Nematode is derived from the Greek words, "Nema" = thread/fibre, "toda" = worm.
- In germany, there is a separate University of Nematology.
- Nematodes can be defined as unsegmented, bilaterally symmetrical, tryploblastic, pseudocoelomate, invertebrate, and thread like worms.
- So far 50000 nematode species are recorded worldwide. 10000 are found in fresh water and soil. 300 species are known to be plant parasites.
- Molya disease ( _Heterodera avenae_) causes 6-7 crore/year loss in Rajasthan and ear cockle ( _Anguina tritici_) causes 8 crore loss in India.
- _Radopholus similis_ was found associated with citrus decline in Florida, USA.
- In India, _Tylenchulus semipenetrans_ was associated with citrus decline.

- Plant parasitic nematodes are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented, pseudocelomate and vermiform animals.
- The body of the nematode may be elongated, spindle shaped, fusiform tapering towards the end but the cross section is always circular.
- Smallest nematode is 10mm long ( _Paralongidorus_).
- Female nematodes are more virulent and agressive than male in attacking and parasitizing the plants.
- Plant parasitic nematode possess spear or stylet.
- Nematodes are known to transmit viruses:
  - Two single stranded RNA virus genera, Nepovirus (NEPO) and Tobravirus (TOBRA).
  - 11 species of Xiphinema transmit 13 NEPO virus (Grapevine fan leaf virus)
  - 11 species of Longidorus transmit 10 NEPO virus
  - 14 species of Trichodorus transmit various strains of TOBRA virus: tobacco rattle and pea early browning

## Crop diseases

### Ergot (Wheat, barley, oats, rye, triticale)

Hosts: 
All grasses, particularly, blackgrass ( _Alopecurus myosuroides_)

Symptoms:

- Causal fungus only attacks ears of flowering, replacing the grain in a few spikelets by a hard, purple black sclerotium, known as ergot.
- Such ergots can be very large, upto 2 cm in length, and very obvious in the standing crop in contaminated grain samples.

Life cycle:

- Ergot is not truely a seed borne disease, however it can be spread by ergots in contaminated seeds.
- At or near harvest, ergots fall to the ground where they remain untill the following summer, when they germinate to produce club-shaped spore bearing structure (stroma). These ascospores are spread by the wind to nearly open flowers of grasses/cereals. The spores germinate in flower, infecting the ovaries. This infection leads to the production of secondary spores (condia) encased in sticky secretion commonly referred to as honeydew. This attracts insects which carry the spores to other flowers, where further infection can occur.
- Wheat and other cereals are less severely affected than rye although, occassionally more open-flowerd wheat variety can be badly affected.
- Disease is favored by cool, wet conditions during flowering which facilitate spore production and prolong the flowering period, making infection more likely.

Importance:

- Very little direct effect on yield.
- Affects stocks which when fed to flour made with cereals with large amount of toxic alkaloid containing ergot, possess health risks.

### Fusarium

Fusariusm head blight/ear blight, foot rot, seedling blight
Pathogen: _Fusarium spp._ and _Microdochium nivale_
Hosts: Wheat, barley, oats, rye triticale and grasses.

Symptoms:

- Form a complex of diseases on seeds, seedlings and adult plants.
- _Microdochium nivale_ (formerly known as _Fusarium nivale_) is seed-borne pathogen and causes seedling blight resulting in seedling death and thinning of plant stand.
- _M. spp_ (other than _M. nivale_) cause a range of symptoms including brown lesions on stem bases, often restricted to outer leaf sheath.
- _Fusarium lesions_ often begin in the leaf sheath at the stem base where crown roots split the leaf sheath when emerging.
- This infection can spread up the leaf sheath causing long dark brown streaks at the stem base. The other symptom in cooler regions is brown staining of lower nodes.
- In older plants, fusarium infection can produce a true foot rot, where the stem base becomes brown and rotten, resulting in lodging and white heads.
- Symptoms are prevalent in very dry seasons as well.
- Ear blight causing fungus: _F culmorum_ and _F graminearum_ are common. Other are, _F avenaceum_, _F poae_ and _F langsethiae_.
- Infection frequently results in the whole or part of the ear becoming bleached.
- Symptoms seen when ears become infected during the early flowering stages, later infection may result in infection of grain but without obvious bleaching of the ears.
- Important due to its mycotoxin that gets accumulated in grains.

Life cycle:

- Most important source is seed but fungus survives on debris in soil also.
- Spores are splashed in canopy causing ear blights and seed borne infection, in wet seasons, especially during flowering and grain formation.
- Most fusarium species have competative saprophytic abilities which allow them to colonize debris and stubble in soil.

Importance:

- When wet season coincides with flowering high levels of ear blight can occur.
- Due to seed borne nature of pathogen, seed treatment plays role in preventing seedling loss in wheat.

### Major diseases of jackfruit

1. Pink disease ( _Botryobasidium salmonicolor_)

## Detection, isolation and media preparation for pathogen diagnosis and study

In many cases the pathogen cannot be identified directly by visual observation because it is mixed with one or more contaminants, for these the isolation of the pathogen (whether bacterial or fungal) is necessary.

If the identity of the pathogen is suspected or determined and a specific nutrient medium that allows only the growth of that pathogen is available, then the isolation of the particular pathogen is achieved by growing a small section of infected tissue on such medium.

Preparation for isolation

1. Sterilization of plastic items or glasswares, such as petri dish, test tubes, pipettes, by dry heat (\SIrange{150}{160}{\celsius} for an hour), or autoclaving, or by dipping for one minute or more in 70-80\% ethyl alcohol.
2. Preparation of solution for surface treatment (with 0.5\% sodium hypochlorite) of the infected tissue sample to reduce surface contaminations.
3. Preparation of culture media on which the isolated fungal or bacterial pathogen will grow.

Most media contain an extract of a natural source of carbohydrates and other nutrients, such as potato, corn meal, lima bean, or malt extract, to which variable amounts of agar are added to solidify the medium and form a gel on or in which the pathogen can grow and be observed. The most commonly used media are potato dextrose agar (PDA), which is good for most, but not all fungi; water agar or glucose agar (1–3\% glucose in water agar) for separating some oomycetes (Pythium) and fungi (Fusarium) from bacteria; V-8 and other less rich media, which encourage fungal sporulation; and nutrient agar, which contains beef extract and peptone and is good for isolating bacterial plant pathogens. Fungi can also be separated in culture from bacteria by adding 1 or 2 drops of a 25% solution of lactic acid, which inhibits the growth of bacteria, to 10 milliliters of the medium before pouring it in the plate. Solutions of culture media are prepared in flasks, which are plugged and placed in an autoclave at \SI{120}{\celsius} and 15 pounds (6.8 kg) pressure for 20 minutes \ref{fig:culture-preparation}. Sterilized media are then allowed to cool somewhat and are subsequently poured from the flask into sterilized petri dishes, test tubes, or other appropriate containers.

```{r culture-preparation, out.width="60%", fig.cap="Preparation of solid nutrient media"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/pathogen-media-preparation.png")
```


4. Sterilization of working table (with 10\% Clorox solution) and tools such as scalpels, forceps and needles.

It should be noted that some groups of fungi, namely Erysiphales, causes of the powdery mildew diseases, and the oomycetes Peronosporaceae, causing downy mildews, are considered strictly obligate parasites and cannot be grown on culture media but can be grown on leaf-containing dishes. Fastidious phloem- and xylem-limited bacteria also either are impossible to grow in culture so far or must be grown on special complex nutrient media.

Isolation may be done either from leaves, from stem, fruits, seeds, and other ariel plant parts or from roots, tubers, fleshy roots, and vegetable fruits in contact with soil.

If the infection of the leaf is still in progress in the form of a fungal leaf spot or blight and if there are spores present on the surface, a few spores may be shaken loose over a petri plate containing culture medium or picked up at the point of a sterile needle or scalpel and placed on the surface of the culture medium. Also, infected tissues may be placed in a moist chamber to allow the pathogen to grow out on the tissue and then pick off spores and fruiting bodies and plate them out. If the fungus does grow in culture, isolated colonies of mycelium will appear in a few days as a result of germination of the added spores.

The most common method, however, for isolating pathogens from infected leaves, as well as other plant parts, involves cutting several small sections 5 to 10 millimeters square from the margin of the infected lesion so that they contain both diseased and healthy-looking tissue. These are placed in one of the surface sterilant solutions, making sure that the surfaces get wet. After about 15 to 30 seconds, the sections are taken out aseptically one by one and at regular intervals (e.g., every 10–15 seconds) so that each of them has been surface sterilized for different times. The sections are then blotted dry on clean sterile paper towels or are washed in three changes of sterile water and are finally placed on the nutrient medium, usually three to five per dish. Those sections surface sterilized the shortest time usually contain contaminants along with the pathogen, whereas those surface sterilized the longest produce no growth at all because all organisms have been killed by the surface sterilant. Some of the sections left in the surface sterilant for intermediate periods of time, however, will allow only the pathogen to grow in culture in pure colonies. These colonies of the pathogen are then subcultured asceptically for further study.

## International Plant Protection Convention (IPCC)

The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) is an international plant health agreement that aims to protect cultivated and wild plants by preventing the introduction and spread of pests. International travel and trade are greater than ever before. As people and commodities move around the world, organisms that present risks to plants travel with them.

### Organization

- There are over 180 contracting parties to the IPPC.
- Each contracting party has a national plant protection organization (NPPO) and an Official IPPC contact point.
- Nine regional plant protection organizations (RPPOs) work to facilitate the implementation of the IPPC in countries.
- IPPC liaises with relevant international organizations to help build regional and national capacities.
- The Secretariat is provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

# Entomology

Definition of pest encompasses anything that,

- Competes with humnas, domestic animals, or desirable plants for food or water,
- Injures humans, animals, desirable plants, structures, or possessions,
- Spreads disease to human, domestic animals, wildlife, or desirable plants,
- Annoys human or domestic animals.

Types of pests include:

- insects, such as roaches, termites, mosquitoes, aphids, beetles, fleas, and caterpillars.
- insect-like organisms, such as mites, ticks, and spiders,
- microbial organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, nematodes, viruses, and mycoplasmas,
- weeds, which are any plants growing where they arc not wanted,
- mollusks, such as snails, slugs, and shipworms, and
- vertebrates, such as rats, mice, other rodents, birds, fish, and snakes.

Categories of pests include:

- continuous pests that arc nearly always present and require regular control.
- sporadic. migratory, or cyclical pests that require control occasionally or intermittently.
- potential pests that do not require control under normal conditions. but may require control in certain circumstances.

Pest control goals can be one of the following:

- prevention -- keeping a pest from becoming a problem.
- suppression -- reducing pest numbers or damage to an acceptable level, and
- eradication -- destroying an entire pest population.

## Principles

1. Most organisms are not pests. A species may be a pest in some situations and not in others.
2. Accurate identification is the first step in an effective pest management program. Correct identification and understanding of a pest (life cycle, factors that influence it's development and spread), enable making efforts to minimize damage when it is most likely to harm and to identify best measures to that effect.
3. Determination of pest control goal. Intervention is only appropriate when when the pest is causing or is expected to cause more harm than is reasonable to accept. In such circumstances, control strategy should be aimed to reduce the pest numbers to an acceptable level.
4. Determination of threshold levels
5. Continuous pest monitoring
6. Use appropriate management strategies based on the goal which includes one or more of the following approaches,
  - Natural control (Natural enemy, Geographical barriers, Food and water supply, Climate, Shelter)
  - Applied control (Physical control, Mechanical control, Host resistance, Biological control, Cultural control, Chemical control)

**Threshold Levels**

Thresholds are the levels of pest populations at which you should take pest control action if you want to prevent the pests in an area from causing unacceptable injury or harm. Thresholds may be based on esthetic, health, or economic considerations. These levels, which are known as "action thresholds," have been determined for many pests.

A threshold often is set at the level where the economic losses caused by pest damage, if the pest population continued to grow, would be greater than the cost of controlling the pests. These types of action thresholds sometimes are called "economic thresholds."


## Pesticide toxicity

- A pesticide is any substance used to control pests. Pests may be target insects, vegetation, fungi, etc. Most control the pests by poisoning them. Unfortunately, pesticides can be poisonous to humans as well.

- Toxicity: The toxicity of a substance is its capacity to cause injury to a living system. A living system can be things such as a human body, parts of the body (lungs or respiratory system), a pond, a forest and those creatures that live in there. Toxicity represents the kind and extent of damange that can be done by chemical. In other words, if you know the toxicity of a pesticide, you know how poisonous it is.

- Dose-time relationship of pesticide toxicity
  - Dose is the quantity of a substance that a surface, plant or animal is exposed to.
  - Time means how often the exposure occurs.
  - This relationship gives rise to two types of toxicity.
  1. Acute toxicity: This refers to how poisonous a pesticide is to a human, animal or plant after a single-term exposure. It generally implies the effect that occurs within 24 hours of exposure.
  2. Chronic toxicity: This refers to delayed poisonous effects from exposure to substance.
  
- Routes of entry:
  1. Local: local effect refers to those that take place at the site of contact with material. e.g. skin irritation/inflammation on th hand in response to hand contact, irritation of mucous membrane lining the lungs due to inhalation of toxic fumes.
  2. Systemic: Effect that occur away from the original point of contact. These pesticides are distributed throughout the body once they enter. They function by blocking or stimulating a chemical signal, generally that of the nervous system (Cholinesterase).

- Pesticides may have following actions:
 - Additive, antagonistic or synergistic
 - Immediate or delayed
 - Reversible or irreversible action
 
- Exposure may result in following effects:
  - Reproductive effects
  - Teratogenic effects: Effect on unborn offspring, such a birth defects.
  - Carcinogenic effects: Cancer in living animal tissues.
  - Oncogenic effects: Tumor forming effect (not necessarliy cancerous)
  - Mutagenic effects: Permanent effect on genetic material that can be inherited
  - Neurotoxicity: Poisoning of nervous system, including the brains.
  - Immunosupression
  
Acute toxicity measures

To figure out how acutely toxic a pesticide is, scientists give laboratory animals short-exposure to does of pesticide being tested. Experimental doses are given orally, as well as put on eyes, skin, and in the air that test animals breathe. These animals are then carefully observed for the changes.

**LD50**

Amount of a pesticide that has killed half of the animals in a laboratory test. LD50 values are effective for both oral and dermal routes of exposure. But they do not tell us about how the chemical acts, nor about how sensitive different organs within an animal or human might be. LD50 for different chemicals can be compared if the same test animial was used. The LD50 values are measured in unit of weight called mg per kg (or interchangeably, parts per million).

**LC50**

This measure of toxicity gives the acute inhalation toxicity.

Chronic toxicity measures

There is no standard measure like LD50 for chronic toxicity studies. Often the length of the experiment is in days, months or years and the amount of each dose is stated. For e.g., a study of chronic oral toxicity might look like, "8 mg of pesticide to rats daily for two years. No symptoms of poisoning appeared."

- Two classes of pesticides, organophosphates and carbamates can slowly poison by attacking an essential body chemical called "cholinesterase". The chronic exposure to Organophosphate pesticides can be measured by monitoring changes in blood cholinesterase levels. In humans, decrease in cholinesterase levels are sure sign that exposure to these types of pesticides should be avoided untill the level is measured as being normal again.

### Status of pesticide use in Nepal

- Initially, DDT was imported in 1952 AD for control of Malaria.
- For the same purpose, DDT was reimported in 1955 AD.
- For use in crops, DDT was imported in 1956 AD.
- Organochlorides were introduced in 1950s, organophosphates in 1960s, carbamates in 1970s and synthetic pyrethroids in 1980s, respectively.
- Aggregate consumption of pesticides in Nepal is 396 g a.i. per hectare in 2014 AD which is increasing in recent years.
- 90\% of the pesticides imported in Nepal is for vegetable which is 1400 gm ai per hectare.
- There are 132 types of pesticides registered for use in Nepal. Nepal banned 24 pesticides till 2020.
- The pesticide consumption is increasing by about 10-20\% per year, with more intensive use recorded in terai region, in districts such as Chitwan and Kathmandu, where there is greater commercial orientation.
- In general, cropwise analysis of pesticide use signals alarming levels of residues, hence their current state of use being haphazard.
- Thapa, 2003 ascribes following quantities of pesticide use in respective commodities:
  - Tea: 2100 gm/ha
  - Cotton: 2560 gm/ha
  - Vegetables: 1400 gm/ha

Government of Nepal has currently enforced the Pesticide Management act, 2076 and regulations. The legal document prescribes framework for registration of pesticide, license for sales, distribution, storage, commercial use and spray as well as use and management of pesticides by different structure of government.

The task of control, regulation, registration and management of the pesticides are assigned to two government bodies;

1. Pesticides management committee (Chairmanship of secretary MoALD)
2. Registration and management center (Plant Quarantine and Pesticide Management Committee)

## Pesticide residue assessment

### Rapid bioassay of pesticide residues (RBPR)

This is a technique recently being used in Nepal in Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market to test the pesticide residue present in fruits and vegetables. ...



## Pesticide poisoning



## Farmers' field school (FFS)

Farmers' field school (or Farmer field school) is a widely used extension approach to educate farmers in agriculture. This approach was initated in Nepal with the FAO supported TCP project on community IPM in 1998 for the integrated management of BPH in rice fields. In addition, FFS curricula have been developed for the integrated pest management in different crops including maize. Different levels of facilitators (Officer, assistant level staff and farmers themselves) have been developed for different pests specific to crops.

While it may be worthwhile to train and aware local farmers on localized sporadic insect outbreaks, mass information campaign, rural radio broadcast, participatory video exhibition and community action plans may be needed to contain widespread regional outbreak of pests (like Fall armyworm outbreak in late 2019).

Integrated pest management (IPM) is the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations, and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human and animal health and/or the environment. IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms (definition from the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management, FAO/WHO, 2014). In order to support this, IPM implementation in Farmer Field Schools is based on four practical principles.

- Grow a healthy crop in a healthy farming system
- Conserve natural enemies
- Observe fields regularly
- Farmers become experts

These principles describe the main actions of IPM implementation through FFS. Specific processes that take into consideration the variation of each field and farm family backup each principle, so that management can be done on a field-by-field, season-by-season basis. IPM is not a "packaged technology", but also a decision-making process that is adopted by farmers and farming community it is gradually improved with greater ecological knowledge and observation skills.

## Pest survey and surveillance

### Survey

An official procedure conducted over a defined period of time in a given area to determine if pest are present or not, and if present also the kind and characteristics of the prevalent pest is called survey.

- Survey are phased, i.e. done only once to determine certain characteristic of a pest. for e.g., risk factors for a crop due to given pest at a certain point of time.
- Surveys can also be classified as being either pest survey, commodity or host survey and targeted or random survey.

### Surveillance

Surveillance is the monitoring of the behavior or activities or other changing information. It refers to continuous observation of a place in order to gather information.

There are 2 types of surveillance:

1. General surveillance

Useful means for National Plant Protection Organizations to gather pest information beyond specific surveys. It can be delivered in following ways:

- undertake desktop reviews of scientific journals, publications and databases
- deliver outreach and awareness campaigns to inform the audience about the target pests and ways in which they can assist
- ensure mandatory reporting for agencies and institutions involved in scientific research and publication -- in some cases this may involve legislative obligations or cooperative agreements to report.

General surveillance systems must comply with International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM-8) (Determination of pest status in an area) validation process, and so require adequate screening, validation, data management and analysis to manage data before they are included in information management systems.

2. Specific surveillance
  - Detection survey: "Survey conducted in an area to determine if pests are present". Detection surveys are appropriate if a pest’s presence in an area is not known.
  - Delimiting survey: "Survey conducted to establish the boundaries of an area considered to be infested by or free from a pest". Delimiting surveys are usually used to define the boundaries of spread for a new, invasive pest. A delimiting survey often precedes the implementation of an eradication programme. Delimiting surveys may also be useful for shipping commodities outside of the pest range for a pest of limited distribution.
  - Monitoring survey: "Ongoing survey to verify the characteristics of a pest population". Monitoring surveys are appropriate to document changes in prevalence of a particular pest population over time and to assist with pest management.

### Importance of pest surveillance

- Detect and monitor pest threats in order to prevent their introduction and to manage them if they become present in the country -- this can be achieved by using:
  - pest alerts
  - unofficial and official information regarding the occurrence or changing status of a pest for which a pathway has been identified
  - reports in the press
  - scientific but unofficial reports
  - published data
- Maintain and enhance market access and international trade by collecting and providing current surveillance data on the status of pests associated with commodities that are being or will be traded
- Gain the confidence of trading partners by ensuring the availability of current and reliable data on pest status in the country
- Support the preparation and updating of regulated pest lists and technically justifiable import requirements
- Put in place phytosanitary improvement measures in the context of national programmes, including those that relate to the establishment and maintenance of PFAs, pest free places of production (PFPPs), pest free production sites (PFPSs) and ALPPs where specific conditions must be met in order to support exports
- Enhance food security and protect the environment through effective monitoring of threats to national plant resources.

### Example survey design for target pest Pink Bollworm

The pink bollworm moth, _Pectinophora gossypiella_ (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a globally important pest of cotton. Prevention, management and yield loss associated with pink bollworm costs cotton producers in the United States of America an estimated US$32million annually. Pink bollworm is capable of long-range migration and so cotton producing regions are at constant risk of infestation and reinfestation. Effective long-term surveillance is necessary to detect incursions and reduce the risk of establishment.

#### Sampling and collection methods for adults

- At planting, hang delta traps containing rubber septa impregnated with 4mg of gossyp-lure pheromone attractant around the perimeter of cotton fields at a rate of one trap per 4ha.
- Inspect delta traps weekly for adult pink bollworm moths, until harvest or killing freeze. Record presence (and quantity) or absence

#### Sampling for larvae

- Select ten non-Bt cotton fields per 4856–6070ha at random and visually inspect the blooms for signs of pink bollworm larvae. If larvae are detected, collect specimens and preserve in 70percent ethanol to send out for expert identification.
- Start at the bloom stage and continue weekly inspection through cut-out. Record presence (and quantity) or absence.

#### Information mangement

- Sampling data may be recorded on paper or by electronic means in the field, but should be permanently stored in a secure electronic database. The NPPO should establish procedures for generating reports from field survey data and disseminating reports to relevant parties.

#### Occupational safety

Field survey workers will need the following to safely perform their survey activities.
- Basic first aid items, such as antiseptic wash, sterile bandages, pain reliever tablets and antihistamines.
- A field communications plan to keep workers connected to base operations. This may include mobile telephones or radio communications.
- Safe transportation to and from field sites.

#### Stakeholder engagement

Pink bollworm survey plans are best enacted with the cooperation of producer communities and government regulatory entities. Develop survey plans with cotton growers and create stakeholder buy-in through effective communication with the target audience.

## Description of major insects

### Pink bollworm ( _Pectinophora gossypiella_)

- Notorious chewing type insect of cotton in all cotton growing areas.

**Symptoms of damage**

- Rosetted flowers
- The holes of entry plugged by excreta of larvae which are feeding inside the seed kernels. Larvae cut window holes (interlocular burrowing) in the two adjoining seeds thereby forming 'double seeds'.
- The attacked buds and immature bolls drop off.
- Discolored lint and burrowed seeds.

**Identification**

Larvae

- Shows color variation, however, young larvae are white and late instar are mostly black, brown, green to pale or pink.
- Several dark and light alternating bands running the entire length

Adult

- Forewings are brown or dull yellow olive grey with dark spots.
- Hindwing margins are deeply fringed.

**Management**

- Clean cultivation and destruction of crop residues (fallen leaves, twigs, ets. before the onset of season)
- Plough deeply to expose the hibernating larvae/pupae.
- Avoid late sowing of the crop. Early sowing helps in early maturity, facilitating escape.
- Witholding irrigation water to avoid prolonged late boll production/formation to reduce the build up of over-wintering population.
- Acid delinting of cotton seeds.
- Release of egg parasitoids, _Trichogramma chilonis_ or _E. Johnstoni_.
- Spray Triazophos 40 EC 2.5 liter per hectare and Quinalphos 20\% AF in alternation even after 100 DAS.

### Cotton Jassid/Leafhopper ( _Amrasca biguttula biguttula_; Family: Cicadellidae)

- It is a major insect of Cotton, Okra and Sunflower.
- The adult cotton jassid is about 2.6 mm (0.1 in) in length, yellowish-green, with a conspicuous black spot on either side of the head and another near the tip of the fore wing. The head is pale green and the membranous wings transparent and iridescent. On leaf surfaces, the insect tends to move about diagonally, and when disturbed it immediately jumps and flies away.

**Symptoms of damage**

- Tender leaves become yellow, curl-up and fall off.
- The insects also secrete honeydew, and sooty mould often grows on this, restricting the amount of light reaching the plant's photosynthetic surfaces and reducing the yield.
- In severe infestation, leaves get a bronze or brick red color which is typical "hopper burn" symptom.
- The margin of the leaves get broken and crumble into pieces when crushed.

**Management**

- Seed treatment with Imidacloprid 70 WS at \SI{7}{\gram\per\kilo\gram} to protect upto 8 weeks (for cotton).
- Early sowing and closer spacing of cotton reduces pest infestation.
- Neem oil formulation \@ 0.5\% thrice at fortnightly intervals.
- Spray any one of the following insecticides (500 liter per hectare spray):
  - Imidacloprid 200 SL at 100 ml/ha
  - Methyl demeton 25 EC 500 ml/ha
  - Dimethoate 30 EC 500 ml/ha
  - Phosphamidon 40 SL 600 ml/ha

### Whitefly ( _Bemisia tabaci_; Family: Aleyrodidae)]

- Also referred to as sweet potato whitefly, it is found world-wide -- tropics, subtropics and less predominantly in temperate habitats.

**Life cycle**

Female _B. tabaci_ will lay 50-400 eggs ranging from 0.10 mm - 0.25 mm on the under part of leaves. Female whiteflies are diploid and emerge from fertilized eggs whereas male whiteflies are haploid and emerge from unfertilized eggs. Eggs are laid in groups, being small in size with dimensions of 0.2 mm wide and 0.1 mm in height. Eggs are initially whitish in color and change to a brown color near hatching, within 5 to 7 days. After hatching, the whitefly nymph develops through four instar stages.

The first instar, commonly called a crawler, is the only mobile nymphal stage. The first instar nymph can grow to about 0.3 mm and is greenish in color and flat in body structure. The next three instars remain in place for 40–50 days, until molting into an adult. Silver exuvia, or shed skins are left on the leaves. The immobile instars appear opaquely white. Nymphs feed by stabbing into the plant with their mouth-parts and sucking up plant juices. Adult whiteflies are approximately four times the size of the egg, with light yellow bodies and white wings, which is attributed by the secretion of wax across its wings and body. Adult silverleaf whiteflies can reach up to 0.9 mm in length. 

**Symptoms of damage**

- Causes damage to plants through feeding and transmitting plant diseases.
- Feeds on its host plants by piercing the phloem or lower leaf surfaces with its mouth and removing nutrients. Affected areas of the plant may develop chlorotic spots, whither, or drop leaves. 
- Whiteflies also produce a sticky substance called honeydew, which can induce the growth of sooty molds, which can then reduce the plants ability to absorb light. This results in slower growth, lower yield, and poor quality plants. It also requires that crops be thoroughly washed after harvesting.
- It transmits gemniviruses including,
  - _lettuce infectious yellows virus_
  - _tomato yellow leaf curl virus_
  - _African cassava mosaic virus_
  - _Cassava brown streak virus_
- It has been known to cause silverleaf on squash, irregular ripening of tomatoes, whitestalk in broccoli and cauliflower, white stem in poinsettia, and light root in carrots.

**Management**

- Growing cotton only once a year either in winter or summer season.
- Adopting crop rotation with non-preferred host such as sorghum, ragi, and maize.
- Removal and destruction of alternate weed hosts like _Abutilon indicum_, _Chrozophore rottlari_ and _Solanum nigrum_
- Timely sowing with recommended spacing, preferably with wider spacing.
- Field sanitation and proper monitoring of pest activites.
- Cultivation of preferred alternate hosts like brinjal, okra and sunflower should be avoided.
- Yellow pan traps and sticky traps \@ 12 per hectare.
- Collection and destruction of whitefly infested leaves from the plants.
- Spray any one of the following plant products alone or in combination with the recommended dose of insecticide (\@ 2 ml per liter of water),
  - Neem seed kernal extract 5\% (50 kg), Neem oil \@ 5 ml per liter of water
  - Fish oil rosin soap \@ 25 mg per liter
  - Catharanthus rosea extract 5\%
- In early stages, spray one of the following (\@ 500 liter per hectare of spray),
  - Methyl demeton 25 EC 500 ml
  - Phosphamidon 40SL 600 ml per hectare
- Spray any one of the following in mid and late stages (1000 liter per hectare of spray),
  - Phosalone 35 EC at 2.5 liter per hectare
  - Quinalphos 25 EC at 2.0 liter per hectare
  - Triazophos 40 EC 2.0 liter per hectare
  - Acephate 75 SP 1.3 kg per hectare
- Predators, parasitoids, and pathogens specific to whiteflies can keep populations under control. Predator families include Phytoseiidae, Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, Anthocoridae, Nabidae, and Miridae, Chrysopidae and Coniopterygidae.

### Fall armyworm (FAW)

The FAW life cycle is completed in 28-48 days depending on temperature and food availability but in laboratory conditions it has been observed to complete in 27-32 days at average daily temperature of \SI{27}{\celsius}. Heavy rainfalls are reported to break the life cycle of FAW. The insect is not reported to have the ability to diapause.

In Nepal, considering the low winter temperatures, migratory FAW are supposed to arrive if allowed by conducive environmental conditions.

**Life cycle**

1. Egg: Creamy white or grey in color covered by light brown wool like material imparting a moldy appearance. The total eggs are dome shaped. The number of eggs per mass varies considerably but is often 100-200, and total egg production per female averages about 1500 with a maximum of over 2000. The female normally deposits most of her eggs during the first 4-5 days of life, but some oviposition continues to occur for upto 3 weeks. On average, adults live for 12-14 days. Egg continues unhatched for 2 days in warm laboratory conditions.

2. Larvae: The FAW has six larval instars. The first instar are whitish in color which later change into greenish color with black head. The larvae measures 30-35 mm long, and their color varies from brown, gray, yellowish, pinkish to greenish with granulated texture all over the body. The total larval period lasts 14-15 days in aforementioned laboratory conditions. Inverted 'Y' shaped whitish marking is present on the head. The best identifying feature of the FAW is a set of four large spots (pinacular) that form a square on the upper surface of 8th segment of body. The late instar larvae also have three creamy yellow stripes on the dorsal surface which run in parallel manner from thorax to last abdominal segment. Larvae tend to hide themselves in the plant whorls during the sunny day.

3. Pupa: The FAW normally pupates in the soil at a depth of about 2-8 cm. The larvae constructs a loose cocoon by tying together particles of soil with silk. The pupae is reddish brown in color, measuring 14-18 mm in length and about 4.5 mm in width. Duration of pupal stage is 6-8 days in lab conditions.

4. Adult: Moths have a wingspan of 32-40 mm. Hind wings in both male and female are white with black lines on inner margins. Adult male moth of the insect has distinct markings on the forewings whereas markings on female forewings are not distinct. In male moth, the forewing generally is shaded gray and brown, with triangular white spots at the tip. Brown and oval shaped spot is present at the center of forewings. The forewings of females are less distinctly marked, ranging from a uniform grayish brown to a fine mottling of gray and brown. Adults are nocturnal, and are most active during warm, humid evenings. Duration of adult life cycle (as observed in laboratory conditions in Nepal) is 5-7 days.

**Feeding behavior and damage**

The larvae can feed and damage entire plant including leaves, whorls, tassels, silk and ears. Early instars (1st and 2nd) feed by scrapping the leaf surface leaving the epidermis intact which results in the appearance of elongated papery windows of different size. They also bore into the whorl resulting into small pin holes.

Larvae of 3rd and 4th instars voraciously feed on foliage showing ragged and elongated holes on plant and size of holes increase with the growth of the larvae. Both 5th and 6th instars feed extensively and result in leaf area loss or defoliation overall. Severe feeding gives the appearance of maize plant that has been damaged by hail. After feeding, the larvae leave behind large amounts of moist saw dust like frass near the whorl and upper leaves.

In the maize crops' reproductive stage, taseel and ear are vulnurable to being bore into. The larvae can feed on kernels of ear affecting the yield, or cause quality deterioration due to mycotoxin contamination.

**List of pesticides that can be of potential use against FAW management**

1. Azadirachta indica extracts (Margo NF), Azadirachtin (Agriguard, astan-killer, astha neem super-1, etc.)
2. Bacillus thuringiensis (Chandani-5 WP, Lipel, Mahastra-0.5 WP)
3. Chlorantranilipole 18.5% SC (Allcora, Nicora gold, coragen, ferterra 0.4% GR) at the rate 0.4 ml/ltr of water.
4. Emamectin benzoate (Aberkiller, Allclaim) 5% SG at the rate 0.4 g/ltr of water.
5. Metarhizium anisopliae (Biocide manic, Emerald, Lalichakra, Pacer, Peak moti, Recharge, Varunastra)
6. Spinetoram (Delegate) 11.7% SC at the rate 0.5 ml/ltr of water
7. Spinosad (Tracer) (Registered in 2019) 45% SC at the rate 0.3 ml/ltr of water.

**Monitoring of FAW**

1. Trap selection: Suitable trap, it could be Funnel trap or Bucket trap
2.Lure selection: Procure FAW specific pheromone lure, and store lures in a Refrigerator ($4-5^\circ$C); change the lure once every 4-6 weeks.
3. Trap placement and setup: 
  - Establish the pheromone trap two weeks before planting at a height of approximately 1.25 meters from the ground level. 
  - Place the trap in or next to the maize field
  - Install the trap from a long pole in a vertical orientation to prevent water entering into it and adjust the trap height to at least 30 cm above plant height. 
4. Install 3 traps per cluster at the distance of at least 50 meters apart.
5. Trap monitoring and recording: Weekly intervals throughout the season
6. Monitoring and crop phenology/stage
7. Area-wide and community-based approaches in terms of pheromone traps could be more effective than at the individual farm level
8. Record the weather record(temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.),wherever possible.
9. Share and use the FAW monitoring data with extension agents.

**Scouting pattern**

_W pattern_

- Scouting in the field is done in a semi-systematic manner to determine the risk of yield depression associated with foliar feeding and density of small and large larvae. It is one of the approaches that follow a "W" pattern to cover the entire field.
- While entering into the field for scouting at least two outer rows should be left. This is practiced to avoid border effect.
- At every point, inspect 10-20 plants in a row or around the central plant of the point (in case of scattered planting).
- Observe the signs in upper 3-4 leaves for damage or fresh frass carefully in each plant. Fresh frass indicates the presence of living larvae in the whorl.

_Ladder pattern_

**IPM options for FAW**

- Seed and varieties (Seed treatment with Imidachlorpid 48% FS at the rate of 4 ml per kg). This protects plant upto 2-3 after germination.
- Select maize varieties with tight husk cover.


**Cultural management practices**

- Avoid late and staggered planting. Early planting often helps to escape the peak migration and incidence of FAW adults.
- Use of recommended dose of manures and fertilizers.
- Maintain adequate soil moisture for producing vigorous and healthy plants which can withstand pest infestation and damage.
- Ploughing the field to a depth of 10 cm helps to expose FAW pupae to sunshine and natural enemies. Allow soil to be open for 2-3 after plowing for promoting this natural control.
- Adopt push-pull technology incorporating Desmodium grass and other legume crops such as pigeonpea, beans, groundnuts as intercrops for push and border crop of Napier grass for pull.
- Destroy crop residues after harvest for destroying sheltering eggs, larvae and pupae of FAW.
- Practice crop rotation with alternate crops to minimize the attack of FAW.

**Mechanical control**

- Hand picking and crushing of FAW egg masses and young larvae (if found in field) or emmerse them into soap water.

**Biological control**'

- Natural enemies in field should be conserved with a provision of sheltering and pollen resourceful flowering plants around. Some naturally occurring biological organisms identified as effective control agents against FAW include:

1. Predators (Earwigs, Ladybird beetles, Ground beetles, Assassin and flower bugs, predatory wasps, Spiders and Ants)
2. Parasitoids (*Telenomus remus*, *Chelonus insularis*, *Cotesia marginiventris*, *Trichogramma* spp., Fly parasitoids: *Archytas*, *Winthemia*, *Lespesia*)
3. Parasites and microbial pathogens (NPV, MNPV, BT, *Nomuraea rileyi*, Entomopathogenic nematodes (*Heterorhabditis, Steinernema*))



**Botanicals and indigenous management options**

- Use of local botanicals (neem, hot pepper, titepati, timur and other plant extracts) act as antifeedant and repellant against FAW.
- Sugary sprays, oil, "fish soup" or other materials can also be used to attract ants and wasps to the maize plants.

**Use of chemical pesticides**

### Soybean hairy caterpillar ( _Spilosoma obliqua_)

- Eggs are laid in cluster on the under side of leaves.
- Larvae is hairy with black and red hair (3-9 weeks).
- Feeds gregariously in foliage upto 3rd instar and feeds whole foliage part of plant after 4th instar.
- Adults have light yellow wings, larger spot in hind wings and small black spot in fore wings. They bear red abdomen.

**Symptoms of damage**

- Young larvae feed gregariously on chlorophyll mostly on the under surface of the leaves, due to which the leaves look like brownish-yellow in colour.
- In later stages the larvae eat the leaves from the margin.
- The leaves of the plant give an appearance of net or web

**Management**

- Deep summer ploughing.
- Avoid pre monsoon sowing.
- Use optimum seed rate.
- Adequate plant spacing should be provided
- Intercrop soybean either with (early maturing) pigeon pea variety or maize or sorghum in the sequence of 4:2 should be practiced.
- Collect & destroy infested plant parts, egg masses and young larvae.
- Field Sanitation: Remove the infested plant parts at least once in 10 days and bury them in compost pit to monitor and reduce the population.
- Light Trap: Install one light trap (200W mercury vapour lamp) per hectare to catch the adults of some nocturnal pests such as hairy caterpillar (positively phototropic).
- Apply Chlorpyriphos 20 EC \@ 1.5 lit/ha or trizophos 40 EC \@ 0.8 Lit/ha or quinalphos 25 EC \@ 1.5 lit/ha.
- Dust Chlorpyriphos 1.5% DP quinalphos 1.5% \@ 25kg/ha when the population is likely to reach 10/m row length (ETL). Repeat it as needed.

### Leaf miner of tomato ( _Tuta absoluta_)

The tomato leafminer (aka. Tomato pinworm and South American tomato moth) is a species of moth in family Gelechiidae. _T. absoluta_ was originally described in 1917 by Meyrick as _Phthorimaea absoluta_. The pest was finally described under the genus Tuta as _T. absoluta_ by Povolny in 1994. In India, Maharashtra state tomato cultivation were affected in Nov 2016.

Its life-cycle comprises four development stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. Adults usually lay eggs on the underside of leaves or stems, and to a lesser extent on fruits. Adult female live 10-15 days and male live 6-7 days. 

After hatching, young larvae penetrate leaves, aerial fruits (like tomato) or stems, on which they feed and develop. Larvae drop to the ground in a silken thread and pupate in soil. Pupae (length: 5–6 mm) are cylindrical in shape and greenish when just formed becoming darker in colour as they are near adult emergence. Adults are 6–7 mm in length and present filiform antennae and silver to grey scales. Black spots are present on anterior wings, and the females are wider and more voluminous than the males. The adult moth has a wingspan around 1 cm. In favorable weather conditions eight to ten generations can occur in a single year. 

```{r tuta-larvae, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/tuta_absoluta.jpeg")
```


The pest mainly presents nocturnal habits, and adults usually remain hidden during the day, showing greater morning-crepuscular activity with adults dispersing among crops by flying. Among a range of species within the Solanaceae, tomatoes ( _Lycopersicon esculentum_ Miller) appear to be the primary host of _T. absoluta_. 

**Management**

- Removing and destruction of infested plant parts. Tomato is the main host of the plant, but _T. absoluta_ also attacks other plants of the nightshade family -- Potato, eggplant, pepino, pepper and tobaccoo, including solanaceous weeds like _Datura stramonium_ and _S. nigrum_.
- Deep ploughing in spring season followed by solarization of field.
- Continuous irrigation and inundating of field can help prevent pupation.
- Crop rotation
- Use of exclusion net (especially in nursery condition); Mesh size of less than 1.6 mm is recommended.
- Use of sticky trap and light traps and yellow delta trap are useful in monitoring of _T. absoluta_ populations.
- Para-pheromone TLM lure in Wota-T traps. The para-pheromone traps are used to monitor the adult moths. 5 Wota-T traps/ropani or 1 light trap/ropani.
- Quarantine measures
- Neem based pesticides (Neem raj), Jholmol botanicals
- Imidacloprid, Emamectin benzoate (KINGSTAR, EMAR), Chlorantaniliprole (ALLCORA and CORAGEN) 18.5% EC 1 ml per 3 ltr of water sprayed every 10-15 days, Spinosad (TRACER) 45% SC 1 ml per 3 ltr water sprayed every 10-15 days, Chlorpyriphos and Cypermethrin.
- Chlorantaniliprole, Spinosad and Flubendiamide (ryanoid class) all have waiting period of 7 days, while Emamectin benzoate, ranked as Moderately hazardous has waiting period of 10 days.
- _Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki_ (1% WP 2 g per 1 ltr water sprayed every 7 days) have shown some efficiacy in controlling outbreaks of this moth. Similarly, _Metarrhizium anisopliae_ ($1 \times 10^8$ CFU per gram ) 200-250 gm per ropani can be used for soil treatment.

**Monitoring of pest**

Crop damage should be monitored every two weeks. If noted abnormal minining in the leaf, with signs of mesophyll tissues being eaten and transparent veins exposed, suspect for presence of larvae of the pest. Tips of plant should show black massess, an indication of insect excreta. Fruits may show irregular strips of white coloration initially. In severe infestation, whole plant may appear as wilted. The larvae of Tuta will not enter diapause unless food is scarce. It is identifiable with characteristic pink colored body of 0.9 cm having half crescent rings like appearance in head.

## Integrated pest management

IPM is ecologically sound, environmentally non-pollutive, and sustainable to the economies of poor nations.

Integrated Pest Management aims to suppress pest populations below the economic injury level (EIL). The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization defines IPM as "the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human health and the environment. IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms."

An American IPM system is designed around six basic components:

1. Acceptable pest levels
2. Preventive cultural practices
3. Monitoring
4. Mechanical controls
5. Biological controls
6. Responsible use

The Plant Protection Center and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) have been encouraging farmers to grow flowers, okra and beans on rice paddy banks, instead of stripping vegetation, as was typical. The plants attract bees and a tiny wasp that eats planthopper eggs, while the vegetables diversify farm incomes.

### Development of resistance in insects

Nepal has been using chemical pesticides since 1955. In the beginning, they were considered to be boon for the farmers with sightings of dramatic yield increases, as well as being useful against of serious tropical diseases like malaria.

It was soon found that new chemicals were also responsible for environmental damage. People were poisoned through land, water and food. Indiscriminate use of pesticides was found to be responsible for creating new biotypes -- "super bugs".

Pyrethroid, endosulfan, organophosphate and carbamate insecticides created a resistance to them in the larvae of _Helicoverpa armigera_ in Nepal. _H. armigera_ strains from Pokhara showed a 12-fold resistance to pyrethroids in 1993 and that in 1995 in Nepalgunj was 103-fold. During the same period, 2-3 fold tolerance to endosulfan was recorded in Pokhara.

### IPM in Nepal

- In 1997, Nepal adopted the Community IPM (CIPM) and first project of that was implemented in 1998 as Farmer's Field School (FFS) in Chitwan (Kumroj and Kathar area) for the management of pest (Brown Plant Hopper) in spring rice.
- From the 9th five year plan (1997-2002), Government of Nepal listed IPM-FFS on the top priority.
- Nepal received additional financial support from the Norwegian Government under the technical support of FAO Regional Community IPM (CIPM) of Asia for 1998 - 2000.
- In 1999, one year after the first IPM-FFS lunched, two INGOs (CARE and World Education) also joined the CIPM program in Nepal.
- National IPM program (2003)
- Support to National IPM-FFS program (SNIPM) Phase-I (2004-2007)
- National Agriculture Extension Strategy (2006) of Department of Agriculture (DOA) has also given priority to IPM-FFS model. 
- Support to National IPM-FFS program (SNIPM) Phase-II (2008-2012)

## IPM techniques in pest control

1. Cultural method

- Sanitation and good husbandry
- Tillage
- Crop rotation
- Use of manure and fertilizer
- Proper timing of sowing and harvesting
  - Yellow stem borer and mustard aphid damage increase if harvest is delayed
- Procuring pest free seeds
- Use of resistant varieties;

- Non-preference, antibiosis, tolerance
- Plant-spacing
- Crop location

### Physical control

- Manipulation of temperature: High temperature, burning, low temperature
- Manipulation of moisture: Draining of moisture, grain drying
- Manipulation of light
  - Insects are attracted to the light of wavelength \SI{3650}{\angstrom},
  - Ultraviolet lamps may be used,
  - Yellow or red unattractive lamps may be used
- Use of radiant energy: Cobalt-60 sourced gamma radiation may be used to sterilize pupae of screw-worm fly
- Use of sound wave

### Mechanical control

Broadly, mechanical method of control includes following measures:

*Destruction*: Handpicking, shaking, beating, sieving and winnowing.

*Exclusion*: Banding, wrapping of fruits, wire gauge screening, trench digging, covering materials, pest smashing/collecting devices, use of water barrier, trapping.

## Methods of fertilizer application

The choice of method and time of fertilizer application depends on the form and amount of fertilizer, convenience of the farmer, the efficiency and safety of fertilizer application.

### Solid form

1. Broadcasting: Fertilizers and manures are scattered uniformly over the field before planting the crop and are incorporated by tilling or cultivating.
2. Drilling and placement
  - Plough sole placement (applied or dropped in the plough sole, which will be covered by the plough during the opening of adjacent furrow)
  - Deep placement (applied at a depth of 10-12 cm, especially in the puddle rice soil)
  - Sub-soil application (applied in the subsoil especially for tree crop and orchard crops at depth above 15 cm)
3. Location or spot application: Fertilizers are placed in the root zone or the spot near the roots from which roots can absorb easily.
  - Contact of drill placement: Fertilizers or manures are placed at the time of drilling for placing the seeds. They will have good contact with the seeds or seedlings.
  - Band placement: Placement of manures or fertilizers or both in bands on the side or both sides of the row at about 5 cm away from seed or plant in any direction. They are of 3 types;
    i. Hill placement: In widely spaced crops, like cotton, castor, cucurbits fertilizers or manures are applied on both sides of plants only but not continuously along the row.
    ii. Row placement: In widely spaced crops between rows (Example–Sugarcane, maize, tobacco, potato) manures or fertilizers are placed on one or both sides of the row in continuous bands.
    iii. Circular placement
  - Pocket placement: Application of fertilizers deep in soil to increase its efficiency, especially for the sugarcane. Fertilizers are put in 2 to 3 pockets opened around every hill by means of a sharp stick.
  - Side dressing: It refers to hill and ring placement of manures or fertilizers. It consists of spreading the fertilizer between the rows or around the plants.
  - Pellet application: Nitrogen fertilizers are pelleted like mud ball or urea super granules (USG) and placed deep (10 cm) into the saturated soils (reduced zone) of wet land rice to avoid nitrogen loss from applied fertilizers.

### Liquid form

1. Foliar application
2. Fertigation
3. Starter solution: Solutions of fertilizers prepared in low concentrations which are used for soaking seeds, dipping roots, spraying on seedlings etc., nutrient deficient areas for early establishment and growth
4. Direct application to the soil: Liquid fertilizers like anhydrous ammonia are applied directly to the soil with special injecting equipments. Liquid manures such as urine, sewage water and cattle shed washing are directly let into the field.

## Pesticide formulation

Pesticides in their natural state may be solid, liquid, volatile, non-volatile, soluble or insoluble. Hence, these have to be made in forms suitable and safe for their field use. A pesticide formulation is prepared by the manufacturer by blending the active ingredient with substances like solvents, diluents, inert carriers, surfactants, stickers, stabilizers etc.

### Solid formulations

Dustable powder: Dust particle of size between \SIrange{1}{4}{\micro\meter} are usually suitable for dusting. It is done in early morning when there is no wind and foliage is wet with dew. Dust formulations generally contain 0.1-25\% toxicant.

Granules (G): The inert material (carrier) is given a granular shape and the herbicide (active ingredient) is mixed with sand, clay, vermiculite, finely ground plant parts (ground corn cobs) as carrier material. Toxicants of particle size of 0.25-2.4 mm are appropriate for use as granules. e.g., Alachlor granules.

### Liquid formulations

Emulsifiable concentrate (EC): An emulsion is a two phase dispersion involving water and imiscible solvent. A concentrated herbicide formulation containing organic solvent and adjuvants to facilitate emulsification with water. Presence of oil in the emulsion makes it more toxic and leaves a more resistant deposit than that of suspension. e.g., Butachlor.

Wettable powders (WP): Insecticides or herbicide insoluble in water are mixed with carriers that are capable of making a fine suspension in water. Contains 25-50\% toxicants and rest is wetting or dispersing agent. The material is finely ground so that it may form a suspension when agitated with a required volume of water e.g., Atrazine.

Aerosol: Insecticide mixture contained in a volatile solvent which is expelled through a fine orifice as gas under pressure to produce a fine spray of minute (\SIrange{0.1}{50}{\micro\meter}) particles. It is mostly effective against flying insects.

Water soluble concentrates (WSC): e.g., paraquat.

### Gaseous formulations

1. Dry fumigants
2. Liquid fumigants

## Pest risk analysis

The PRA process is a technical tool used for identifying appropriate phytosanitary measures. It evaluates scientific evidence to determine whether an organism is a pest. If so, the analysis evaluates the probability of introduction and spread of the pest and the magnitude of potential economic consequences in a defined area, using biological or other scientific and economic evidence. If the risk is deemed unacceptable, the analysis may continue by suggesting management options that can reduce the risk to an acceptable level. 

The PRA process may be used for organisms not previously recognized as pests (such as plants, biological control agents or other beneficial organisms, living modified organisms), recognized pests, pathways and review of phytosanitary policy. The process consists of three stages:

1. Initiation;
2. Pest risk assessment; and
3. Pest risk management.

The PRA process is initiated in Stage 1 with the identification of an organism or pathway that may be considered for pest risk assessment, or as part of the review of existing phytosanitary measures, in relation to a defined PRA area. The first step is to determine or confirm whether or not the organism considered is a pest. If no pests are identified, the analysis need not continue. The analysis of pests identified in Stage 1 continues to Stages 2 and 3 using guidance provided in other standards. Information gathering, documentation and risk communication, as well as uncertainty and consistency, are issues common to all PRA stages.

The pest risks posed by the introduction of organisms associated with a particular pathway, such as a commodity, should also be considered in a PRA. The commodity itself may not pose a pest risk but may harbour organisms that are pests. Lists of such organisms are compiled during the initiation stage. Specific organisms may then be analysed individually, or in groups where individual species share common biological characteristics.

The PRA process is applied to pests of cultivated plants and wild flora, in accordance with the scope of the IPPC. It does not cover the analysis of risks beyond the scope of the IPPC. Provisions of other international agreements may address risk assessment (e.g. the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to that convention).

Provisions of the IPPC regarding pest risk analysis

The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC, Article VII.2(a)) requires that: "Contracting parties shall not ... take any of the measures specified in paragraph 1 of this Article [i.e. phytosanitary measures] unless such measures are made necessary by phytosanitary considerations and are technically justified."

Article VI.1(b)requires that phytosanitary measures are: "limited to what is necessary to protect plant health and/or safeguard the intended use and can be technically justified by the contracting party concerned."

"Technically justified" is defined in Article II.1 as: "justified on the basis of conclusions reached by using an appropriate pest risk analysis or, where applicable, another comparable examination and evaluation of available scientific information."

Article IV.2(f) states that the responsibilities of the national plant protection organization (NPPO) include "the conduct of pest risk analyses". The issuing of regulations is a responsibility of the contracting party to the IPPC (Article IV.3(c)), although contracting parties may delegate this responsibility to the NPPO.

In conducting a PRA, the obligations established in the IPPC should be taken into account. Those of particular relevance to the PRA process include: 

- cooperation in the provision of information
- minimal impact
- non-discrimination
- harmonization
- transparency
- avoidance of undue delay.

PRA Stage 1: Initiation

Initiation is the identification of organisms and pathways that may be considered for pest risk assessment in relation to the identified PRA area.

A PRA process may be triggered in the following situations (initiation points):

- a request is made to consider a pathway that may require phytosanitary measures
- a pest is identified that may justify phytosanitary measures
- a decision is made to review or revise phytosanitary measures or policies
- a request is made to determine whether an organism is a pest

The initiation stage involves four steps:

- determination whether an organism is a pest
- defining the PRA area
- evaluating any previous PRA
- conclusion

When the PRA process has been triggered by a request to consider a pathway, the above steps are preceded by assembling a list of organisms of possible regulatory concern because they are likely to be associated with a pathway.

PRA Stage 2: Pest risk assessment

Stage 2 involvesseveral steps:

- pest categorization: the determination of whether the pest has the characteristics of a quarantine pest or RNQP, respectively
- assessment of introduction and spread:
 - candidates for quarantine pests: the identification of the endangered areaand assessment of the probability of introduction and spread
 - candidates for RNQPs: assessment of whether the plants for planting are or will be the main source of pest infestation, in comparison to other sources of infestation of the area
 
- assessment of economic impacts:
 - candidates for quarantine pests: assessment of economic impacts, including environmental impacts
 - candidates for RNQPs: assessment of potential economic impacts associated with the intended use of plants for planting in the PRA area (including analysis of infestation threshold and tolerance level)
- conclusion, summarizing the overall pest risk on the basis of assessment results regarding introduction, spread and potential economic impacts for quarantine pests, or economically unacceptable impacts for regulated non-quarantine pests.

The outputs from pest risk assessment are used to decide if the pest risk management stage (Stage 3) is required.

PRA Stage 3: Pest risk management

Stage 3 involves the identification of phytosanitary measures that (alone or in combination) reduce the risk to an acceptable level.

Phytosanitary measures are not justified if the pest risk is considered acceptable or if they are not feasible (e.g. as may be the case with natural spread). However, even in such cases contracting parties may decide to maintain a low level of monitoring or audit regarding the pest risk to ensure that future changes in that risk are identified.

The conclusion of the pest risk management stage will be whether or not appropriate phytosanitary measures adequate to reduce the pest risk to an acceptable level are available, cost-effective and feasible.

Aspects common to all PRA stages

- Uncertainty
- Information gathering
- Documentation
- Risk communication
- Consistency in PRA
- Avoidance of undue delay

- European Union banned the import of Nepalese honey in 2002 AD, while recognizing honey produced only by the European honeybee ( _Apis mellifera_).

### Diseases of honeybee

1. European foul brood
- Both _A. melifera_ and _A. cerana_ species of bees are affected, with sympotoms prominent in larval stage.
- Causative organism: _Melisococcus plutorious_ (bacteria)
- Once the bacteria infects the larvae, the body of the insect turns yellow, initially and brown later on, eventually the larvae decays.

2. Thai sac brood
- Observed in both _A. melifera_ and _A. cerana_ species.
- Causative agent: Thai Sac Brood Virus
- This disease was first observedin Thailand.
- Sacbrood virus causes an uneven brood pattern with discoloured, sunken or perforated cappings scattered throughout the brood.
- The virus multiplies within the infected larvae, which cause the larvae to sit in the cell with their heads raised and causes the larvae to die shortly after capping.
- The superficial layer of the infected larvae becomes tender and sac-like, with yellow fluid inside.
- The Sacbrood virus may remain viable in dead larvae, honey or pollen for up to four weeks.

3. Chalk brood
- Causative agent: _Ascosphaera apis_ (fungus)
- Mostly affects colonies during winter season
- As infection progresses, larvae grows stiff and eventually appears whitish chalk-like.

4. American foul brood
- Affects larval stage of the insect
- As of recent, it has not been observed in Nepal
- Causative agent: _Paenibacillus larvae_ (bacteria)

5. Nosima
- Affects adult form of the insect
- Causative agent: _Nosema apis_ (unicellular parasitic fungus)
- The dormant stage of _N. apis_ is a long-lived spore which is resistant to temperature extremes and dehydration, and cannot be killed by freezing the contaminated comb.
- This disease causes unusually heavy intestine injuries in the bees, no diarrhea, preferential affliction of older collecting bees. Bees die far away from the dwellings, as when they leave they are too weak to return.

6. Paralysis
- Disease affects adult stage of life form of the insect.
- Bees crawl with loss of flight ability when affected.
- Causative agent: Chronic bee paralysis virus

## Semiochemicals

**Allomones** are communication compounds that function in interspecific communication. They fall within the broad classes of chemical signals referred to as allelochemicals or allelomones. On contact with an individual of another species, an allomone evokes a behavioral and/or a physiological response in the receiver. Allomones are of benefit to the releaser, usually to the detriment of the receiver. Key among these are their roles as defensive secretions against predators or other natural enemies, such as the formic acid sprayed by formicine ants and the venom from many social wasps, social bees, and ants. Compounds including organic acids, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, hydrocarbons, phenolics, quinones, amines, alkaloids, sulfides, steriods, and proteins have all been identified as allomones in various social insects.

**Kairomones** a chemical substance emitted by an organism and detected by another of a different species which gains advantage from this, e.g. a parasite seeking a host. This "eavesdropping" is often disadvantageous to the producer (though other benefits of producing the substance may outweigh this cost, hence its persistence over evolutionary time). The kairomone improves the fitness of the recipient. In the Ponderosa Pine tree ( _Pinus ponderosa_), a terpene called myrcene is produced when it is damaged by the Western pine beetle. Instead of deterring the insect, it acts synergistically with aggregation pheromones which in turn act to lure more beetles to the tree.

## Mulberry cultivation

Silkworm feeds on mulberry ( _Morus spp_; Family: Moraceae) leaves. Rearing of silkworm involves cultivation of mulberry trees. Thus it is essential to cultivate mulberry while rearing silkworm.

- The crop can be grown upto 800 masl.
- For optimum growth and good sprouting, atmospheric temperature is preferable in the range of \SIrange{13}{37}{\celsius} (Ideal range: \SIrange{26}{27}{\celsius}).
- Optimal relative humidity: 65-80\%
- Sunshine: 5-12 hours/day
- Annual rainfall of \SIrange{600}{2500}{\milli\meter} mm or an average of 50 mm once in 10 days is considered ideal for vegetative growth of Mulberry.

### Land preparation and planting

- Initially land is deep ploughed to a depth of 35-40 cm
- In second tillage, soil is pulvarized.
- Soil conditions of 6.2-6.8 pH is considered best.
- Soil should be devoid of injurious salt and alkaline soil is not preferred either.

### Varieties

- Irrigated: Kanva-2, MR-2, S-30, S-36, S-54, V-1
- Semi-irrigated: Kanva-2, MR-2
- Rainfed: S13, S34, RFS-135, S-1635

### Propagation

- Mulberry is mostly propagated through cuttings.
- Cuttings may be planted straight away in the main field or nursery.
- Root saplings may be transplanted in the main field.

### Selection of planting material

- Generally, the mulberry plants are raised from semi-hard wood cutting
- Cuttings are obtained from well established garden stocks of 8-12 months old. Only full grown trees having thick main stem, free from insects, diseases damage, and with diameter of 10-12 cm of the cutting branch are considered suitable for cutting.
- Cutting should be 15-20 cm in length with 3-4 active buds and be given a slanting cut at the bottom end.
- Care should be taken to make a sharp clean cut at the both end of cutting without splitting the bark.
- Sapling is the rooted cutting of specific age 120-150 days upto 240 days. A sapling with well developed root system establishes well and grows vigorously.
- While raising sapling nursery, bed should be pulverized well and well rotten FYM should be incorporated 20-25 days prior to planting.

**Nursery establishment**

- Generally, bed of size 240 cm x 120 cm is sufficient for 180 cuttings with 20 cm x 8 cm row-row to cutting-cutting spacing.
- For 100 cuttings,
  - Length: 240 cm
  - Breadth: 120 cm
  - Cutting-cutting distance: 10 cm
  - Row-row distance: 30 cm
- Bund size: 25-30m cm width and height
- FYM/Compost/Vermicompost of quantities according to the constituent soil texture are applied, i.e. 4 kg per bed for black clay soil.
- For protection against termites, drench the soil and nursery bed with \SI{15}{\milli\liter\per\liter} of water. Likewise, malathion dust is usually applied later on in case insect damage is seen.
- VAM \@ \SI{100}{\gram\per\meter\squared} is desirable to promote healthy root growth.
- Irrigation channels of 25-30 cm width, 15-20 cm depth should be constructed between the nursery beds.
- Irrigation is given immediately after planting to prevent desiccation of sapling and subsequent are so scheduled to meet crop and soil specific requirements.
- Before uprooting, transplanting and planting of saplings from the bed the bed is watered thoroughly.
- Nursery bed is loosened with the help of hoe/ _khurpa_ to a depth of 30 cm and saplings are taken one by one without damaging roots.
- 3-4 month old saplings are ready for transplanting; Good saplings attain a height of 90-120 cm in 3-4 months and 150 cm in 5-6 months.
- Extended preservation of saplings should be avoided, and they must be dispatched to planting site on time. For long distance transport, saplings must be packed in bundles covering with gunny bags or with green leaves.

**Pre-treatment of cuttings with Azospirillium**

- Azospirillium induces early rooting in the cutting.
- Mix 1 kg of Azospirillium culture in 40 ltr of water. Keep the bottom end of cuttings for 30 minutes in the mixture before planting.

### Planting

- Rainy season planting is preferable over winter and summer season.

### Application of fertilizers and interculture

- Fertilizer application depends upon soil type, water presence, variety of mulberry, weather etc.
- NPK \@ 250:125:125 kg/year, 1st top dressing is done at 2 months after planting, 2nd on 4th month and the other doses split applied on each pruning.
- Mulching is beneficial to enhance establishment by checking weed growth and nutrient leaching as well as by maintaining soil temperature. It is done usually with mulberry leaves, twigs and other materials like straw and dried leaves.

### Major weed

1. _Cyperus rotundus_ (Nutgrass)
2. _Cynodon dactylon_ (Bermuda grass)
3. _Abutilon indicum_ (Indian mallow)
4. _Amaranthus viridis_ (Pig weed)

### Pruning

- It is done to ensure vigorous growth of plant and for production of good quality leaves.
- Taken up when plants attain a height of about 2m in length.

### Harvesting

- Harvesting is mostly done with hand by plucking leaves and by cutting branches with sickles. It is preferable to harvest during morning hours.

## Sericulture (Silkworm rearing)

Sericulture or silk farming the process of rearing silkworm for the production of silk. Silk was first produced by China. It has became an important business as well as cottage industry based business in Brazil, China, France, Russia, India, Korea, etc.

- China and India are two major producers with more than 60\% of world's annual silk production.
- Silk is produced from the moth species i.e. _Bombyx mori_ (Family: Bombycidae), although the genera have several species.

### Importance

- Provides employment to and is source of income for middle as well as poor class families.
- Used in making clothing fabrique, larger garments, mat and other its directly used by human.
- Mulberry, which the worm is fed on is an useful fodder tree.
- Mulberry cultivation and worm culture may both be integrated for rearing in marginal land while only employing least external inputs.

### Silkworm types and life cycle

There are 5 major types of silkworm of commercial importance, obtained from different species of silkworms which feeds on a number of plants except mulberry. Other varieties of silk are generally termed as non-mulberry silk, some common type of silkworm and their silks are:

1. *Bombyx mori* (Silk type: Mulberry silk)

Most of the commercial silk produced in the world comes from _Bombyx mori_ and the silk is known as mulberry silk. _Bombyx mori_ feeds on leaves of mulberry plant. These silkworm are completely domesticated and reared indoors. India produces 92 \% of total mulberry silk.
2. *Antheraea mulitta* (Silk type: Tasar silk): This from of silk is copperish in color and coarse. It is used mainly for decoration of interiors of clothes.

Silkworm undergoes complete metamorphosis \ref{fig:bombyx-mori-life-cycle}. Larvae feed on the leaves of the mulberry (family Moraceae, genus _Morus_); They will consume other genera in this family, but growth rate is reduced. At \SIrange{23}{25}{\celsius} the five instars require 25 to 30 days to hatch. Toward the end of fifth instar, _B. mori_ spin a cocoon over a 3-day period and pupate within that cocoon; the pupal stage lasts for about 10 days. After molting to the adult has occurred inside the cocoon, the moth emerges. The moth softens the cocoon by orally excreting a special enzyme, cocoonase, and then emerges from the end of the cocoon. The female moth mates the same day as emergence and begins egg deposition. One generation of B. mori spans 40 to 45 days.

Voltinism (i.e., the number of generations occurring in a single year) has a genetic basis, but it is also strongly affected by environmental factors. Some races are univoltine (only one generation a year); others are bivoltine (two generations a year) or polyvoltine (three or more generations a year, as seen in tropical silkworms that do not undergo diapause). Voltinism is closely tied to the geographic distribution of silkworms, which are divided into Japanese, Chinese, European, and tropical races. Typically, the silkworms distributed in the cold regions are univoltine, those distributed and adapted to warm regions are bivoltine, and those in tropical regions are polyvoltine.

In silkworms, larval ecdysis is induced by a molting hormone secreted by the prothoracic gland, which is located inside the first thoracic spiracle. The role of the prothoracic gland in ecdysis was discovered in 1944, and the molting hormone, ecdysone, was structurally determined in 1954 in studies that used large amounts of silkworm pupae as material. Ecdysone was the first hormone to be isolated from an insect species.

### Rearing considerations

#### Hatching and brushing

Silkworm eggs are of 2 types -- hibernating and non-hibernating. Further processing of the eggs depends upon whether they are of thediapausing or the non-diapausing type. Univoltine races lay only diapausingeggs. Multivoltine races lay only non-hibernating eggs while the behaviour of the eggs of the bivoltine is intermediate. Hibernating eggs require special treatment to make them hatch.

These eggs are stored till the next season or awakened from diapause artificially. The eggs stored are taken out and subjected to incubation to achieve uniform hatching on a desired day. This can be achieved by exposing the eggs to certain range of environmental conditions. The incubation of eggs is one of the essential parameter in silkworm rearing.

Silkworm rearing requires care and skill. Since various rearing operations are important which finally reflect on cocoon quality and quantity. The rearing room activity starts with brushing of newly hatched silkworms. Since silkworms are susceptible for any kind of diseases and cannot with-stand to any changes in the environmental conditions, the rearing room should be prepared in such a way not to hamper the growth of the worms. On the other hand mulberry garden should posses 5-6 leaves. It is better to tap the shoots 25-30 days prior to the date of brushing.

The equipments such as foam rubber strips, chawk rearing trays,feather (white), paraffin paper, chopping board and knife, mats are kept ready for rearing.

The desire race of silkworm DFLs (Diseased Free Layings) are pro-cured from grainage. The eggs are protected from ants, rats. They are incubated well and later kept in black box.

Eggs after reaching blue egg stage are kept in black/box/paper/cloth and kept in dark. In this way early maturing embryos are prevented from hatching and late maturing embryos are given time to develop and catch up with the early maturing ones.

The eggs hatch out in response to phototrophic stimulus. This method favors hatching more than 90 percent. If hatching is not uniform and only 50-60 percent of eggs hatch on the first day, brushing can be postponed to next day as well. If necessary hatched worms can be separated and kept in tissue paper and stored in fridge at 100C.When the second batch hatch our the refrigerated eggs are mixed and brushed together.Even blue egg stages can also be pre-served at 50C for 2-3 day.

Silkworm eggs are available loosely and on egg cards. The newly developed larvae breaks out the egg shell and comes out, and is called hatching. The hatched larvae are collected and reared. The newly hatched larvae are black, hairy and look like small ants and are called "ants" or "kego". It is always better to brush the larvae in the morning. Generally, brushing should not be dealyed. If necessary, due to irregular hatching, only it should be postponed to next morning/cool hour of the next day. Freshly emerged larvae can also be preserved at \SIrange{7}{10}{\celsius} for one day.

When the eggs hatch, the emerged larvae are to be collected for rearing. This process of separating kego/ants from egg shell is called "brushing". It means placing of mulberry leaves on a frame to attract the larvae so that they will be separated from their shells. The optimum time for brushing is around 10am when the humidity is 85-90% and temperature \SI{27}{\celsius}.

Normally hatching starts at 5-6 am when the eggs are exposed to early sun rays. Uniform hatching can be expected by 7-8 am. After 2 hours the newly hatching worms develop appetite and begin to crawl. Thus the suitable time for brushing would be 10am but once again it depends upon the weather conditions.

Before brushing, rearing facilities should be prepared according to the number of silkworms to be reared. Tender mulberry leaves should be chopped to 3-5 mm size. When the worms crawl over into the tray worm bodies should be disinfected for disease prevention by using a fine-mesh sieve to dust a fine powder of formalin (3%).

It is of two types i.e. brushing of loose eggs and brushing from egg cards.

### Garden management

**Selection of leaves**: Leaves are selected from amongst the largest glossy leaves, 3rd or 4th from top. The leaf should be soft, pliable, green and palatable. Size of the chopped leaf is around 5-15 cm.

**Leaf preservation**

Silkworm grows best when fed with succulent leaves which are rich in nutrients and moisture. Leaves not properly stored dry and become unpalatable to the worm. For best outcomes, harvested leaves should be preserved in fresh condition in a wet gunny cloth. Gunny bags are advantageous in that they dissipate the moisture evenly when sprayed with water to maintain the freshness of the leaves.

**Cleaning**

- Cleaning is the process of removing silkworm excreta and left over leaves in the rearing bed. In the 1st stage of larvae (before worm moults), one cleaning is done per day.
- In the 2nd stage, two cleanings are given, one after resuming feeding and 2nd right before second moult.
- A net with mesh size of 0.5 x 0.5 cm is spread over the rearing bed and leaves are spread over the net. The worms crawl through the net and come to fresh leaves. The net along with the worms and leaves are transferred to another tray.
- The left over leaves, excreta and litter are discarded.

### Moulting and rearing

- Moulting is the process of shedding or losing of old skin/feather and covering with new skin/feather.
- At the time of moulting care should be taken not to disturb the worms.
- Correct detection of moulting and feeding are important for uniform growth of silkworm. During moulting, rearing bed should be kept thin and dry by applying lime \@ \SIrange{30}{50}{\gram\per\meter\squared}. Also, there must be good areation.
- Rearing of first three instars is called chawki rearing. These larvae are resistant to high temperature and humidity and grow well ensuring good cocoon crop.
- The total weight of the worm is attained in chawki rearing.
- Feed is given four times a day.
- The molting time for 1st age is 20 hours. 2nd and 3rd age require a day.
- The 4th and 5th instar larvae are considered as late stage of worm. They are reared in bamboo trays.
- These worms require less humidity and preferable low temperature. This stage is the real feeding stage. The worms consume about 90\% to 95\% of the total feed.
- Newspaper strips are spread over trays to absorb excess moisture in leaves and faecal pellets. The temperature and humidity requirement gradually comes down as the stages advance.
- Leaves of medium maturity (6th leaf onwards) are fed to 3rd and 4th instars and coarse leaves are fed to 5th instars.
- Newly moulted worms are dusted with ceresin lime prior to first feed to prevent muscardine.
- There are three methods or rearing but in all methods importance is given to, the maintenance of leaf quality, humidity, temperature so as to ensure vigorous and healthy development. The rearing methods are -- Paraffin paper rearing, Box rearing and Co-operative rearing.
- After attaining full growth in final instar, the worms cease to feed and start to spin. Such worms are slightly translucent and raise their heads up, to find place for spinning.
- These worms have to be picked and transferred to a mountage for spinning cocoons.

### Spinning and cocoon formation

- Moulting of worms should not be delayed as the ripened worms will waste silk.
- About 500-900 worms per square are kept on a mountage.
- Mountage should be kept under shade in well ventilated place.
- Quality of silk depends upon the care taken at the time of spinning.
- Mature worms are sensitive to temperature, humidity, light, etc. at the time of spinning.
- Ripe worms require space equal in area to square of length of its body for spinning.
- Proper spacing avoids wastage of silk and avoids double cocoons.
- To prevent staining (discoloration) of cocoons, keep mountage in an inclined position so that urine may drop to the ground.
- Remove dead worms and non-spinners on 2nd day of spinning.
- To protect from ants, apply malathion \@ 5\% in the mountage area.

**Maintenance of humidity**

- Fluctuating of humidity causes abrupt thinning or thickening of silk filament.
- Relative humidity of 70\% is considered ideal for spinning.
- Provide proper ventilation and straw not below the mountage.
- Provide even and moderate lighting. Improper lighting causes crowding of larvae to shaded area leading to double cocoons.

### Harvesting of cocoons

- Worms completes spinning in 2-3 days but the cocoons should not be harvested at this time because worms inside are still in pre-pupal stage.
- Harvesting should be done on 5th day when pupae are fully formed and hard.
- Do not harvest when pupae is in amber color.
- Dead and diseased worms on the mountages should be removed before harvest.
- Marketing should be done on 6th day.
