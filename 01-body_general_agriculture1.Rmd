### Agro-climatic and physiographic zones of Nepal

Nepal's geography makes the country's climate particularly complex. Because of the extreme variations in elevation within short distances, Nepal's climate varies significantly across the country, ranging from alpine and arctic in the north to tropical in the south. The country experiences tropical, meso-thermal, micro-thermal, taiga and tundra types of climate (MoFSC, 2014). As illustrated in Table \ref{tab:climate-nepal}, the temperature and precipitation vary strongly with altitude. 

```{r geographical-region-nepal}
tribble(~"region", ~"elevation", ~"climatic_zone", ~"average_annual_precipitation", ~"average_annual_temperature", 
        "High himal", "Above 5000 m", "Tundra and arctic climate", "150-200 mm", "Less than \\SIrange{3}{10}{\\celsius}", 
        "High mountains", "\\SIrange{3000}{5000}{\\metre}", "Alpine and subalpine", "\\SIrange{150}{200}{\\milli\\metre}", "Less than \\SIrange{3}{10}{\\celsius}", 
        "Middle mountains", "1000-3000 m", "Cool to warm temperate", "275-2300 mm", "\\SIrange{10}{20}{\\celsius}", 
        "Siwalik", "\\SIrange{500}{1000}{\\metre}", "Sub-tropical", "\\SIrange{1100}{3000}{\\milli\\metre}", "\\SIrange{20}{25}{\\celsius}", 
        "Terai (low-laying plains)", "Below 500 m", "Tropical", "\\SIrange{1100}{3000}{\\milli\\metre}", "\\SIrange{20}{25}{\\celsius}") %>% 
  rename_all(function(x)str_replace_all(x, "_", " ") %>% str_to_sentence()) %>% 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE, escape = FALSE, caption = "Nepal\'s climatic zones (Adapted from MoE, 2010 and MoSTE, 2014)", longtable = TRUE) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1:5, width = c("7em", "7em", "8em", "10em", "8em"))
```

Alternatively, climate of Nepal is classified into 5 distinct types;


```{r climatic-zone}

**Precipitation**

- Monsoon starts from 2nd week of June and ends at 4th week of September (12 June - 21 September)
- Normal period of monsoon in Nepal is 102 days.
- July is the wettest month.
- November receives the lowest precipitation of any year.
- Rainfall ranges from 150-5000 mm per annum.
- Most precipitation occurs during night.
- Mean annual precipitation of Nepal is 1858.4 mm (2012 AD)
- Lowest rainfall occurs at Upper Mustang (less than 150 mm annually)
- Highest rainfall occurs at Lumle, Kaski (Around 5500 mm annually)
- Highest and lowest precipitation area lie in Annapurna area.
- Winter precipitation is high in western region of Nepal.
- Annual precipitation reduction is projected to be 10-20 percent across the country.
- As elevation increases, precipitation also increase up to about 2500 masl in Nepal.
- More than 70% of the monsoon rain water goes waste.

**Temperature**

- Lowest temperature occurs at Winter during December-January.
- Temperature starts decreasing from October.
- Highest temperature recorded in Nepal is \SI{46}{\celsius} in Chisapani, Bardiya and lowest temperature recorded is - \SI{26}{\celsius} in Thakmarpha, Mustang.
<!-- - Based on data (1975-2005 AD), maximum temperature was found to be increasing at a greater rate \SI{0.058}{\celsius \per \year} than minimum temperature \SI{0.03}{\celsius \per \year}. -->
- Average annual maximum temperature over Nepal is \SI{22.4}{\celsius}
- Average annual maximum temperature over Terai region of Nepal is \SI{30.8}{\celsius}.
- Average annual minimum temperature over Nepal is \SI{11.4}{\celsius}.
- Year 2006 AD was the warmest year recorded.
- A study conducted by Nepal Country Vulnerability Study Team in 2009 has projected that Nepal's mean annual temperature may rise by:
  - \SIrange{0.5}{2.0}{\celsius} or \SI{1.4}{\celsius} by 2030 AD
  - \SIrange{1.3}{3.8}{\celsius} or \SI{2.8}{\celsius} by 2060 AD
  - \SIrange{1.8}{5.8}{\celsius} or \SI{4.7}{\celsius} by 2090 AD
- Annual rise in Nepal due to climate change is estimated to at \SI{0.06}{\celsius} (\SI{0.04}{\celsius} when considered Terai region only.)
- Average annual global temperature rise: \SI{0.025}{\celsius}
- Monsoon extremities have been observed in recent years. For example, Nepalgunj in the south-western Nepal recorded rainfall of 336.9 mm within 24 hours on the 27th August 2006, which is the highest for last 123 years.
- The average temperature of the world has increased by \SI{0.74}{\celsius} over the last 100 years.
- Average global precipitation has increased by 0.5-1\% annually. It is decreasing in the equatorial region and increasing in higher latitudes, and especially during the cold season.
- In Nepal, total precipitation has been receding at the rate of 9.8 mm every ten years. However, it is project to increase 3.9-5.1\% in annual precipitation, and increase in number of consecutive dry days (2017).

- For every 100 m rise in altitude, the mean annual temperature drop by -\SI{0.5}{\celsius}.
- Latitude also affects the temperature; for every \SI{3}{\celsius} north, the mean temperature would fall by \SI{1}{\celsius}.

- The lowest layer of atmosphere is the trophosphere which ranges from 8-18 kilometers from earth's surface (average 12 km). 75-80 \% of the atmospheric mass lies in this layer.

### Current form of agricultural governance

Nepal's choice for federal system aims for drastic change in governance system. The government's local self-government Act (LSGA), 1999 tried to provide decentralization authority to local elected government and civil servants working under VDCs and municipalities were directed to function locally. Provisionally, three sectors agriculture extension, education and health were devolved with the objective of prioritizing local needs through local planning and budgeting. The government's inability to hold local election mainly due to maoist insurgency led to non-functioning of LSGA and thus local development officer appointed by MoFALD started acting as elected body, which practically violated the decentralization. The selected civil servants were responsible to central ministry and development offices including District Agriculture Development Office, District Livestock Development Offices, District Education Offices and District Health Offices practiced their development functions with central budget and central priorities. Following the endorsement of new constitution and election of three government, the existing set up will have to be changed completely.

Although unitary system, the structure of agriculture sector was much decentralized. Ministry of Agricultural Development was divided into Ministry of Agricultural Development and Ministry of Livestock Development in later stages. Despite Ministry of Agriculture Land Management and Cooperative was formed by merging then Ministry of Agricultural Development, Ministry of Livestock Development, Ministry of Land Management and Ministry of Cooperative and Poverty alleviation; the temporary adjustments have been set up with three secretaries leading the sectors. Under the secretary for agriculture development, it has two departments namely Department of Agriculture (DoA) and Department of Food Technology and Quality Control (DFTQC); three other central offices namely Nepal Agriculture Research and Development Fund (NARDF), Agriculture Information and Communication Center (AICC) and Seed Quality Control Center (SQCC); Nepal Agriculture Research Council, one board, two companies and four committees. The department of agriculture has a deep rooted structure which includes 12 technical program directorates, 9 national programs, 5 regional directorates, 5 regional training centers, 1 agriculture development plan (JADP), 75 district agriculture development offices, 378 service centers, 15 regional laboratories, 40 farm centers and 15 quarantine offices. The farm centers comprise of vegetables, fruits, fisheries, sericulture, and honeybee development farms. Similarly, Department of Food Technology and Quality Control 11 regional laboratories and inspection offices, one central lab attached with department. The NARC has research stations throughout the country with national and regional research centers.

Now, in attempt to align these structures with the constitutional provision, several breaking changes have been made in the network based on the legislative power provided by Constitution of Nepal (2015). Now the government has 3 tiers, hence the constitution of Nepal has clearly demarcated roles and responsibilities of each government.

Constitutionally agriculture is more state matters although it has also been the concurrent function of all central, state and local government. The authority of agriculture extension lies with local and state while regulatory and policy are the central matters. The constitutional provisions for agriculture sector are listed in \ref{tab:constitutional-provision-agriculture}

The government expedited the restructuring process immediately after passing the constitution. Ministry of General Affairs accomplished the functional analysis of major 5 sectors with the UNDP supported PREPARE (Project to prepare public administration for state reform) project. The functional analysis was made on the basis of 5 principles; subsidiarity principle, economies of scale, social inclusion and national priority, equity and economic stability and unbundling for achieving clear assignment.

Government had formed a high powered federal administration restructuring committee in the chair of Honorable Kashi Raj Dahal of Administrative court to ease the state restructuring process. This high level committee recommended 15 ministries in the central which included Ministry of Agriculture and Land Management by merging existing Ministry of Agricultural Development, Ministry of Livestock Development, Ministry of Land Management and Ministry of cooperatives and poverty reduction. This committee worked quite independently and the recommendations are more practical.

After local election, government formed a high level mechanism to expedite the state restructuring process. This mechanism included 2 high level committee and 6 clusters. The composition of the committees is as following;

A. High level federalism implementation and state restructuring steering committee

### Issues, opportunities and current needs for agricultural development

As agriculture sector contributes to largest portion to GDP, the engagement of the population in the sector has not resulted the growth as anticipated. Efficiency of the sector is around 0.5 as it contributes 27% to GDP with more than 60% of population engaged in this sector. It shows low level of productivity of the sector as a whole. But agriculture sector continues to be the most important sector not only because of its contribution to GDP but also reliance of other sector like Industry and service sectors on it heavily. Agriculture provides major raw materials to agro based industries; tourism and other agribusiness flourish with agriculture growth. APP had already assumed 1.5 multiplier effect of agriculture growth to other sectors of economy. The recent study shows to achieve 10% of GDP growth, Agriculture sector needs to grow by at least 6%. As simply input output relationship may not exist in agriculture production, it requires skills, technology, Knowledge and other parameters like environment conducive for agriculture growth.

Major issues in agriculture sector have been the same since a decade. Agriculture Development Strategy identifies major factors needed to increase productivity as 

i) effective agricultural research and extension 
ii) efficient use of agriculture inputs 
iii) efficient and sustainable practices and use of natural resources (land, water, soils and forests) and 
iv) increased resilience to climate change and natural disaster.

Timely availability of major inputs like fertilizer, seed and irrigation are important for improving productivity; which has not been at proper way. Likewise, management of land is another critical issue in overall agriculture productivity. Land and labor are principal factor inputs whose productivity are of major importance not only in classical economic theory but also in practical base. Average land size is decreasing in Nepal which affects on achieving economy of scale. While at the same time land size in India and China is increasing and they are having good productivity. There is positive correlation between land size and productivity and also with trade balance or export. Tenancy, fragmentation, land degradation and land use planning are critical land issues identified by ADS. Moreover our practice of land ownership transfer to the sons has exacerbated the fragmentation. Likewise use of agricultural land for other purposes like housing and plotting has worsen the case. The then Ministry of Agricultural Development tried to impose policy to distract fallowing of land but never been successful because of the different authorities on land governance. Fortunately, the ministry agricultural development and ministry of land reform has now been merged to form Ministry of Agriculture Land and Cooperative and is expected to impose a strict policy to correct land use planning for enhanced land productivity. The government has forced new policy to avoid fragmentation land by correcting frequent selling of land by plotting is expected to solve this issue temporarily. Moreover it requires economic parameters to avoid such problems. Like in South Korea, any individual wishing to use agricultural land for other purposes have to pay more than current market price of that land to the government as tax.

Prevalence of small landowners resulting subsistence farming is another major issue for agriculture development. The commercialization of subsistence growers is required to lift large mass of population out of poverty. As many of such farmers live in rural areas and existence of poverty in that area is directly correlated with lack of commercialization. However commercialization demands a lot on policy changes like conducive investment environment; enforcement of laws and acts that support contractual arrangements, leasing and land utilization; development of value chains, capacity development of all the actors in forward and backward linkages; availability of quality input in good price, technical backstopping and assured market. The production cost is high in one hand while market margin is huge in other hand and thus has indicated the need for radical improvements in supply chains and market management. The improved connectivity, market information and market intelligence support the commercialization.

Increased competitiveness of the farmers are prerequisite for the continuing engagements in agriculture sector. With the accession to WTO, the consumer‘sright is the first priority and consumers need the quality produce in competitive price regardless of the country of origin. The country need to subsidize the primary major inputs to be able to compete with Indian and Chinese productions. We find very few commodities with absolute competitive advantage with Chinese and Indian production; thus we need to focus on commodity with relative comparative advantage and encourage niche production. The two way strategy are required for import substitution and export promotion. The monetary incentives and subsidies are important to make farmers competitive. High subsidies are required for the crops with comparative advantages while suitable policy, trade facilitation and infrastructure support are required for the crops with relatively competitive advantages and such commodities should be promoted for export.

Absentee landlordism and fallowing of land are increasing and needs to be solved with appropriate policy measures. Low competitive agriculture and increased unemployment has forced millions of youths out of country in search of better source of livelihood which on the other hand evacuating the major labor force required for agriculture works. Such chain effect will ruin the economy and make more dependent on remittances and external aids which are not sustainable. Thus retaining youth in agriculture sector by making it more profitable and competitive is burning issue in Nepal. Likewise addressing the climate issue are important as climate change is already a reality and it has affected the agriculture system heavily. Nepalese agriculture is highly vulnerable to natural disasters and climatic uncertainties.

As a matter of fact, agriculture is a private sector business. But, it has not been the attractive to private sector in Nepal. It needs to be profitable to attract private sector. Government policy should ease private sector investments. The land tenancy issues and unavailability of land contract or land leasing act, private sector find it more tedious business. The poultry, floriculture and seed sub sector has attracted private sectors in recent years, however there are equally other sub sectors that can flourish with suitable policy guide. Nepal has been implementing some donor funded projects like PACT, HVAP, RISMFP, KUBK which emphasize on developing small and medium agro enterprises. Such efforts have been beneficial in attracting private sector investment in agriculture sector.

- In 2016, Cooperative organization act came into force.
- In 2018, Cooperative organization regulations came into force.
- In 2019, Cooperative training center was established.
- In 2020, Cooperative bank was established.
- In 2024, "Village return campaign" was initiated under cooperative program.
- In 2027, Agriculture development bank started managing cooperative organizations.
- In 2033, "Sajha" program was implemented in 30 districts establishing multipurpose cooperatives in VDCs.
- In 2035, Agriculture development bank handed over the managerial responsibility of cooperatives to management board.
- In 2041, Cooperative ("Sajha") organization act came into force.

- In 2069, Ministry of cooperative and poverty alleviation was formed.

- Cooperative campaign was first initiated when implementing first five year plan (In 2013), wherein Rapti Dunn Project was launched and 378 cooperative organizations were established in the course.

Principles by which cooperatives put their values into practice are:

1. Voluntary and open membership
2. Democratic member control
3. Member's economic participation
4. Autonomy and independence
5. Education, training and information
6. Cooperation among cooperatives
7. Concern for society

Importance of cooperatives

- Poverty alleviation
- Social and economic support to low income households
- Combines efforts of small producers and consumers and leads them to a larger scale commercial operation
- Reduces transaction cost, when compared to individual efforts
- Reduces chances of suppression and exploitation by large scale acting merchants
- Effective utilization of available resources and supplies
- Empowerment of local community
- Qualitative development of labor
- Improves bargaining power
- Has a bigger role in operationizing in market demand and supply forces
- Members have ownership in rural development
- Promotion of community welfare
- Community development based on justice and equality
- Produce can have more accessible market
- Quality service could be delivered
- Effective mobilization of consumable goods
- Support in national economy

- 10th five year plan focused on emphasized agriculture based commerce and industries, cooperative farming, cooperative based agriculture input supply, and cooperative based small farmer irrigation project implementation, dairy collection and supply and other cooperative based approach to community development.
- The plan promoted active participation of cooperative groups and private sectors for the efforts.
- National agriculture policy, 2061 has prioritized cooperative based agriculture industries and commerce promotion, farmer group cooperative formation and agriculture wholesale market and haat bazzar established and management via cooperatives.
- To legalize a cooperative organization establishment, it should be registered:
  - Under Organization act in District Administration Office, or
  - According to Cooperative act and regulations under Cooperative Division Office.

Food is a fundamental human right. That leads to food security being one of the greatest challenges facing the world today.

It is predicted that food production must increase by at least 70% before 2050 to support continued population growth, although the size of the world's agricultural area will remain essentially the same [@connor2011crop]. It is projected that global population will reach from 6.8 billion in 2010 to 9.2 billion by 2050. The exponential patterns of world population growth since the 1800s are due to better nutrition resulting from increased food availability, combined reduction of mortality due to improved sanitation, water purification, and medicine. This increased demand for food must be met mostly from yield (productivity) increase on existing cropland.

```

Though localized famine has occurred in some regions of the world, the global catastrophic events predicted by Malthus and Ehrlich have not occurred. This is due in part to continued advancements in agriculture that have increased food supplies. Still, more recently, Norman Borlaug (1904-2009), a leader of developing improved wheat varieties to feed the world, declared in his 1970 Nobel Peace Prize speech, 

:::: {.center data-latex=""}

In a world where we produce enough food to feed everyone, 815 million people - one in nine - still go to bed on an empty stomach each night^[[FAO, IFAD and WFP 2014](http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/2014/en/)]. Though the world has an abundance of food, not everyone has the opportunity to purchase it. More than a billion people in the world live in poverty, which is concentrated in developing countries. Although at a global scale the rate of food production is high, the food available for consumption is not evenly distributed, and 1.02 billion people in 2009 -- 17% of world's population -- face food insecurity. Cereal production in 2008 was at record highs, while at the same time a record number of the world's population was hungry. Food insecurity is pervasive, everywhere.

**What is Food security?**

Food security is defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO](http://www.fao.org/) as:

:::: {.center data-latex=""}

::: {.minipage data-latex="{.5\linewidth}"}

\textit{"when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life."}
:::

\hfill--- Rome Declaration agreed at the World Food Summit

::::

**Why is Food security concerning?**

- There is also a more insidious type of hunger, a *hidden hunger* caused by deficiencies in micronutrients such as iron, Vitamin A and Zinc affecting two billion people. The economic costs of micronutrient deficiencies are considerable, reducing gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.7-2% in most developing countries.
- Global losses in economic productivity due to macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies reach more than 2-3% of GDP.
- GDP growth generated by agriculture is up to four times more effective in reducing poverty than growth generated by other sectors^[[IFAD 2012](http://www.ifad.org/hfs/index.htm)]
- A 1% increase in agricultural yields leads to a 0.6-1.2% reduction in the number of people living below $1 per day^[[Thirtle 2003](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X03001682)].
- Nepal is enlisted as one of the world's most productive food production systems [@connor2011crop]. Although it highlights the role of Nepal and regions-alike in leading global food security movement, challenges remain that farmers themselves are the most vulnerable communities in developing countries, with regard to fulfillment of food secure status.

### Nutrition aspect of food security

The nutritional aspect of food and nutrition security is achieved when secure access to food is coupled with a sanitary environment, adequate health services, and knowledgeable care to ensure a healthy and active life (free from malnutrition) for all household members.

In their 1998 paper^[[The state of world's children: Focus on nutrition](https://www.unicef.org/sowc98/silent4.htm)], UNICEF has highlighted the nutrition aspect of food security. The nutritional dimension is integral to the concept of food security^[[Committee on World Food Security (CFS), Global Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition, 2011](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/cfs/Docs1011/WG_GSF/GSF_annotated_outline_formatted_Rev1_22_Jun_11.pdf)].

```{r nutrition-aspect, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Aspects of food and nutrition security", cache=TRUE, out.width="75%", fig.fullwidth = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/food_security_scale_and_dim.jpg")
```

Different factors and sectors on the global/national level. At global level some or all of the following have prominent role: 

1. The extent of agricultural production
2. Existing infrastructure
3. International policies
4. Gender issues 
5. Trade facilitation

Some factors impact more or less directly the community and household. At national and sub-national level, following factors determine the state of food and nutrition security: 

1. Education
2. Health services
3. Environmental condition
4. Hygienic conditions
5. Local infrastructure
6. Harmonization of national agricultural policies
7. Support to the national Special Programs for Food Security.

Improved food availability and access to food, along with aspects of care, determine the individual's food intake (*food use*); whereas care and questions of health and hygiene influence the individual's health status (*food utilisation*). Food intake and health status are closely related to each other and both determine the level and overall goal of food and nutrition security.

### Regionality of food security

At regional and national levels, the key objective is to ensure the availability of food of acceptable quality. Food availability may be assured through a combination of domestic production and regional and international trade. Successful overall development is the best way of promoting overall food availability. 
National level food security is not synonymous with food self-sufficiency and the promotion of self-sufficiency may run counter to improving food security.

At the household level, the key objective is to ensure sufficient access to food by all households. Access is a function of the demand and purchasing power of both urban and rural consumers. Lack of access to food is basically an outcome of poverty. With 70 per cent of the world's extremely poor and food insecure people living in rural areas, the role of agriculture is crucial to the eradication of poverty. The rural poor depend on agriculture both for their incomes and food entitlements. Chronic food insecurity can be tackled most effectively through policies that promote agricultural productivity, rural incomes and food production (FAO, 2001).

At the individual level, the key objective is to ensure food use and nutritional adequacy. Use of food relates to issues of consumption and nutrition and is affected by nutritional practices, the intra-household distribution of food, mother-child feeding practices and food preparation.

## Dimensions of Food and Nutrition Security^[[Definition and Dimensions of Food Security](https://wocatpedia.net/wiki/Definition_and_Dimensions_of_Food_Security#cite_note-2)]

Four elements build the framework of food and nutrition security: 

1. Availability 
2. Access
3. Use and utilization
4. Stability

The graph below illustrates the three dimensions describing the food flow from availability and access to use and utilization as well as the aspect of sustainability. These aspects are listed in the bottom rectangle in the graph below, representing the temporal determinant, as well as aspects of an enabling environment or frame conditions of Food and Nutrition Security. Stability fundamentally affects all other elements from the basis.

```{r dim-foodsec, fig.cap = "Dimensions of food security", warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/food_security_dimensions.png")
```

### Availability

Availability is about food supply and trade, not just quantity but also the quality and diversity of food. Improving availability requires sustainable productive farming systems, well managed natural resources, and policies to enhance productivity.

Availability refers to the physical existence of food. On national level, food availability is a combination of domestic food production, commercial food imports and exports, food aid and domestic food stocks. On household level food could be from own production or bought from the local markets. Regarding food production, water resources are required to produce the crops. Due to population growth and climate change, the pressure on existing natural resources, namely land and water, increases. Impacts of climate change are often leading to land degradation, lack of irrigation water, reduced soil moisture and therefore losses of economic livelihoods. Together with an increase in conflicts over usage of water resources (cultivation of crops for energetic use vs. cultivation of crops for nutritional use, use by other sectors like drinking water, industry and environment), this may be a threat for long-term food security. With suitable adaptation measures to soil such as irrigation systems improving water-use efficiency through cultivation methods and technologies, or infrastructure development for water harvesting and (re)use of marginal quality water and treated waste water, or improved soil-water management in rain fed systems like, the resilience of agricultural systems can be strengthened, risks reduced and livelihoods secured. Support of local water user groups and strengthening their planning and management skills can help minimize risks of scarce resources and reduce conflicts.

### Access

Access covers economic and physical access to food. Improving access requires better market access for smallholders allowing them to generate more income from cash crops, livestock products and other enterprises.

Access is ensured when all households have enough resources to obtain food in sufficient quantity, quality and diversity for a nutritious diet. This depends mainly on the amount of household resources and on prices. In addition, accessibility is also a question of the physical, social and policy environment. 

Access are of types:

- Physical
- Social
- Economic

Drastic changes in these dimensions may seriously disrupt production strategies and threaten food access of affected households. As an example, developing countries may be affected by severe droughts or floods more and more frequently. Accordingly, the harvest volume shrinks and the prices for food increase, affecting on the availability and accessibility of food for households. To prevent such negative developments, different technical adaptation measures exist. The construction of infrastructure such as small dams and reservoirs or water spreading weirs to hold back water and raise the shallow groundwater tables is one of them, dykes and improved drainage systems for floods are other ones.

### Use and Utilization

Utilization is about how the body uses the various nutrients in food. A person's health, feeding practices, food preparation, diversity of their diet and intra-household distribution of food all affect a person's nutrition status. Improving utilization requires improving nutrition and food safety, increasing diversity in diets, reducing post-harvest loss and adding value to food.

Use describes the socio-economic aspects of household food and nutrition security, determined by knowledge and habits. Assuming that nutritious food is available and accessible, the household has to decide what food to purchase and how to prepare it as well as how to consume and allocate it within the household.

Another aspect is the biological utilization. This relates to the ability of the human body to take food and convert it. This gained energy is very important when it comes to daily physical activities, for example working in agriculture. Beside that utilization requires a healthy physical environment and adequate sanitary facilities as well as the understanding and awareness of proper health care, food preparation, and storage processes. In this context safe drinking water plays an important role, especially for preparing food and creating a healthy environment for the population. Safe drinking water is connected to groundwater which is often contaminated through human, industrial or agricultural waste water in combination with other factors 884 million people worldwide have no access to adequate drinking water.

### Stability

Stability is about being food secure at all times. Food insecurity can be transitory with short term shocks the result of a bad season, a change in employment status, conflict or a rise in food prices. When prices rise, it is the poor who are most at risk because they spend a much higher portion of their income on food. Poor people in Malawi spend nearly 78% of their income on food, while poor in the US, spend just 21%^[[CCAFS 2014](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/35215/IPCC_info_note-3April14.pdf)]. Social nets can play an important role is supporting people through transitory food insecurity.

Stability describes the temporal dimension of food and nutrition security, respectively the time frame over which food and nutrition security is being considered. Stability is given when the supply on household level remains constant during the year and in the long-term. That includes food, income and economic resources. Furthermore it is important to minimize external risks such as natural disaster and climate change, price volatility, conflicts or epidemics through activities and implementations improving the resilience of households. Such measure include insurances e.g. against drought and crop failure as well as the protection of the environment and the sustainable use of natural resources like land, soil and water.

- FAO defined food security in 1996 A.D. 
- In 1996, convention held in Rome approved seven points of food soverignty. 
- Nepal has been a member of FAO since 2007 BS (1950 AD).

McMichael's projection:

- 2 billion people suffer hidden hunger
- 1.5 billion people suffer over nutrition related problems

Since 1981 (2038 BS), FAO started celebrating World Food Day on October 16th. In Nepal, 34th World Food Day was celebrated in 2014 with the slogan: "Feeding the world, caring for the earth".

According to FAO's projection, 52% of the population in South Asia are dependent on Agriculture while agriculture contributes 22% to the total GDP in the region.

**Nepal's status on indicators of food security**

1. Food availability
2. Food access
  - Nepal's poverty rate in 2001/2002 AD: 30%
  - Nepal's poverty rate in 2010 AD: 26%
  - Nepal's poverty rate at the end of 12th plan: 23.8%
3. Food utilization
  - Per person per day recommendation by WHO: 250 ml milk (91 ltr per year)
  - Nepal's aim for per day milk consumption: 156 ml (57 ltr per year)
  - Nepal's aim for per year meat consumption: 14 kg
  - Nepal's aim for per year egg consumption: 48
  - 30% of total daily protein requirement should be met by animal sources.
4. Food stability
  
- In 2011 AD, Nepal ranked 157th among 187 nations in HDI
- In 2014 AD, Nepal ranked 145th in HDI
- Poverty rate at village/rural areas: 27% (Survey, 2012)
- Poverty rate at cities: 15% (Survey, 2012)
- Monthly poverty:
  - Maximum at Chaitra-Baisakh
  - Minimum at Mangsir-Poush
  
State of food security in Nepal:

- Untill 2042 BS (1985), production was twice that satisfied the population's need.
- Upto 2047 BS, food insufficieny was absent.
- Currently 40 districts are declared food minimum and more than 27 districts of high hill and mountain districts are food insecure (when ??).
- Calorie deficiency is prevalent in 41% of population.
- In 19 districts of Midwestern Development Region and Eastern Development Region, food security project is launched.
- 46% of the total cultivated area is under rice.
- Of the total food production, contribution of respective crops are:
  - Rice: 56%
  - Maize: 24%
  - Wheat: 17%
  - Millet: 3.6%
  - Barley: 0.29%

One worrying aspect related to poverty is malnutrition. Indicators of malnutrition, particularly of children are still high not only in traditionally food deficit areas but increasingly also in food surplus areas. About 42% of children less than 5 years old suffer from stunting (NLSS 2010/11).

Three and half million people in Nepal, 13% of the population, are considered to be moderately to severely food insecure, and 42 out of 75 districts are classified as food insecure with respect to food grains (Draft Food and Nutrition Security Plan, MOAD, 2012).

The national cereal balance witnessed surplus of about 886,000 tons (equivalent to over 17% of total requirement) in 2011/12 ?? but in the past decade Nepal's average food grain import was about 5% of domestic production annually. Despite surplus, about 1.8 million people received staple food supplements from government.

### SDG chapter in Nepal

- SDG 2 concerns ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and making agriculture sustainable. With 10 years to achieve these targets, Nepal’s National Planning Commission and several international institutions joined hands to discuss this agenda in December 2019.
- The government mainstreamed the SDGs into national plans and programs, including the 14th Three Year Plan and major sectoral plans.
- The Zero Hunger plan for Nepal is set to be achieved through National Action plan, 2016-2025 within 2025 AD.
- The SDG codes are also assigned to all programs in the national budget. The formulation of the ten-year Zero Hunger Challenge National Action Plan (ZHCN) and Food and Nutrition Security Plan of Action (FNSPA) has added further to these national preparations. The government envisages the FNSPA to become instrumental in reducing the high rates of chronic malnutrition and its outcomes such as stunting, underweight, wasting, and obesity, which will be complimented by the MSNP II (2018-2022).

## Fertilizer policy in Nepal

During 1966–1972, cost-plus basis of fertilizers pricing policy was adopted in Nepal. That policy resulted into higher price in hills than in terai proportional to actual transportation cost incurred. As the international price of fertilizer increased following the oil crisis of 1972, the policy was slightly amended to adopt a more uniform pricing system when Nepalese government fixed the maximum retail price across the country. The subsidy policy aimed to encourage farmers to use fertilizers by providing it at a relatively low price and also to discourage fertilizer flow from Nepal to India by keeping the price 15–20% higher than that of India. Price and transportation subsidies were introduced in some selected high hill and mid-hill districts in 1973/74. For which, the AICL was paid the difference between the actual cost and selling price. With this new pricing system, the hill farmers got fertilizers below the actual cost, whereas terai farmers paid more than the actual cost to cover transportation cost.

With the growing demand for fertilizer and the continuous rise in international fertilizer prices, the government was forced to bear an increasing financial burden as a subsidy allocation. Being a politically sensitive issue, the government was also hesitant to make price adjustments. As a result, this situation aggravated the AICLs losses and that became unable to import fertilizers as per the demand. To partially recover the fertilizer shortages during that period, Nepal obtained additional fertilizer as foreign aid from several countries including Japan, Germany, and Finland. In 1997, the government announced policy reforms in the fertilizer sector eliminating subsidy on non-urea fertilizers and phase-wise withdrawal on urea. Subsidy was completely phased out in 1999. However, deregulation policy largely failed to bring desirable impact on improving supply situation and quality control. High price in international market and heavy subsidy in India cause fertilizer prices in Nepali markets often more than 100% higher than in Indian markets. The porous border and low price in India together resulted into illegal inflow from India to Nepal. The new policy thus worsened the situation unexpectedly.

After the deregulation of 1997, supply from formal sources (AICL and private importers) improved only up to 1998/99. The reasons were retention of partial subsidy in urea before November 1999 and relatively favorable price situation existing in international market. Fertilizer supply after 1999/2000 decreased because both AICL and private importers could not import large quantity due to price fluctuation in international market. Further, both government and private sectors were in trouble in selling fertilizers as heavily subsidized cheap Indian fertilizers, and other adulterated and substandard fertilizers were easily available in the free markets of accessible areas, especially in terai of Nepal. Farmers, however, did not worry about the quality of fertilizers, but they were happy to receive fertilizers at lower price than that were supplied by AICL and authorized private importers. In addition to that, overall supply situation in remote areas was not improved due to high cost of transportation. Therefore, as supply situation was not improved as per the expectation and quality suffered the farmers, amendment on deregulation policy was invited.

Between 2002 and 2009, legal free trade continued to fall due to highly subsidized fertilizer products entering Nepal illegally from India. Vast gap in price and quality of fertilizer through legal and illegal channels were observed at that time. However, farmers paid same prices for both products imported legally or entered illegally. After deregulation of 2002, private sector was encouraged and their supply had increased remarkably. During 2001/02–2008/09, private sector supplied fertilizers dominated the public sector supply. Average share of private sector supply was estimated to be 74% during that period. Finally, GON decided to provide limited subsidy on chemical fertilizers in March 25, 2009, targeting small farmers. Silent features of fertilizer policy (2009) are as follows:

- AICL will be the sole agency to import fertilizers under subsidy scheme.
- Provision of a high-level "subsidy allocation management committee" under the chairmanship of Secretary of MOAC.
- The committee is mainly responsible for fixing retail price and subsidy reimbursement to AICL.
- Subsidized fertilizers will be available for up to 0.75 ha and 4 ha in the hills and terai, respectively, for three crops a year.
- Fertilizers will be retailed through AICL field offices (depots) and cooperatives.
- Sell price in the five entry points (Biratnagar, Birgunj, Bhairahawa, Nepalgunj, and Dhangadi) was set 20–25% above Indian prices at border.
- Retail fertilizer price for farmers through the AICL was set at 20–25% above Indian prices at the border plus transportation cost.

With the partial phaseout of subsidy in 1997, supply from private sector increased continuously with contribution highest to the total supply in 2003/04 (more than 85%). Total supply from both the private and public sector decreased thereafter and reached to the minimum ever in 2008/09 due to illegal flow from India combined with policy uncertainty. With the introduction of subsidy in 2009, total supply increased abruptly and continued to increase until 2013/14. Following the devastating earthquake of 2015, government investment on subsidy decreased resulting into fall in total supply.

### Organic fertilizer production and supply in Nepal

Due to Nepal's constraints to supply quality chemical fertilizers on time, the production and use of organic manures including compost, farmyard manure (FYM), and other biofertilizers seemed compulsory. There were about 30 organic fertilizer producers with total capacity of 100,000 MT/year (2012/13). Of total registered organic fertilizer producing companies in Nepal, 25 got 50\% subsidy in purchasing machine from the department of agriculture. The total capacity of those 25 plants was estimated to be 90,000 MT/year. Some international companies are also working in production and distribution of organic fertilizers in Nepal.

GON has started providing subsidies for biofertilizer production and use from 2011 when \$100,000 was allocated for subsidizing organic fertilizer, particularly vermin compost. Initially, 50% subsidy was provided in purchase of machine used in organic fertilizer production. In addition, MOAD provided price subsidy at the rate of NRs 10/kg of product or 50% of the sell price whichever is less to the farmers for maximum of 1500 kg to a farmer at 50 kg/kattah or 75 kg/ropani.

Bulkiness of product and difficulty in transportation and lack of quality assurance are the major issues for low consumption of organic fertilizers at farmers' level. Slow effect and use of locally produced FYM rather than purchased organic fertilizer are other reasons behind the ineffectiveness of the subsidy policy of organic fertilizer in the country. Due to ineffectiveness of subsidy in organic fertilizer reported from different sectors operating all over the country as well as some unfair trading reported, Supreme Court had announced stay order in the year 2017 after which there is no distribution of subsidized fertilizers from government sector in Nepal.
 
Major policies, orders, and directives related to fertilizer procurement, distribution, and use in Nepal are as follows:

- Fertilizer Control Order 1999
- Chemical Fertilizer Directives 2000
- The National Fertilizer Policy 2002
- National Fertilizer Policy Revisited 2009
- Fertilizer Supply and Distribution Management (District Level) Procedure 2012 (2069)

## Agricultural Perspective Plan (2052/53 -- 2071/72 BS)

The Agricultural Perspective Plan (APP), finalized with the technical assistance of ADB in 1995 was designed to increase agricultural growth whereby per capita AGDP will grow from its 1995 level of 0.5% to 4% per year. This growth was expected to stimulate nonagricultural growth in employment-intensive goods and services in both urban and rural areas. This would open up job opportunities for the poor, particularly poor women, and thereby help reduce the number of rural poor. With implementation of the APP the incidence of poverty was expected to come down from 42% in 1991/92 to 14% in 2014/15, whereas the latter figure without the APP would have been 29%. Poverty in 2011 is estimated at 25%, which is still far from the APP target. The increase in agricultural productivity was also expected to help protect the environment by removing the most fragile land resources from agriculture and putting them under suitable forest cover and other sustainable uses.

The overall objectives of APP were as follows:

1. Accelerate the growth rate in agriculture through increased factor productivity;

2. Alleviate poverty and achieve significant improvement in the standard of living through accelerated growth and expanded employment opportunities;

3. transform agriculture from subsistence to commercial orientation through diversification and realization of comparative advantage; 

4. Expand opportunities for overall economic transformation by fulfilling the preconditions of agricultural development; 

5. Identify immediate, short-term and long-term strategies for implementation, and provide clear guidelines for preparing future periodic plans and programs.

The APP strategy is to accelerate the agricultural growth rate sufficiently to obtain strong multiplier effects on growth and employment, in both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. This growth would occur through technological change to be achieved through investment in research and extension. The APP aims for a broad-based participatory growth across regions and income classes and emphasizes sub-sectors particularly important to women.

The following six strategic thrusts are identified as essential to achieve APP objectives: 

1. A technology-based green revolution in agriculture which becomes the initial engine of accelerated growth;
2. Accelerated agricultural growth which creates a demand-pull for the production of high-value commodities in agriculture, as well as for non-agricultural commodities, with consequent large multiplier effects on other sectors of the economy;
3. Broadly based high employment growth, which then becomes the mechanism for achieving societal objectives;
4. Public policy and investment focus on a small number of priorities, building on past investment in human capital and physical and institutional infrastructure;
5. A package approach to development, which would be different for the Terai, Hills and Mountains and would recognize the powerful complementation between public and private investment and priorities, and would ensure their co-ordination;
6. A regionally balanced and gender-balanced approach that explicitly ensures the participation of women and therefore achieves broad participation.

### Progress summary

APP design gave priority to certain key inputs (i.e., irrigation, fertilizer, technology, roads and power, and financial credit for agriculture), and key outputs (i.e. livestock, high value crops, agribusiness and forestry). Agricultural sector growth has been less than the APP target of 4 % annual AGDP growth, achieving an average of 3.0 %, slightly below the national GDP average growth of 3.5% in the past decade and rising only after 2010 (National Accounts Estimates, Nepal, 2012). 

The agricultural sector in Nepal has made progress in several indicators of well-being and development. For example, income per capita and productivity of agricultural labor has increased, poverty has reduced, and malnutrition has declined. The road network has considerably expanded and irrigation cover has increased as well. In almost all agriculture subsectors (crop, livestock, fishery, and agroforestry) there has been progress in terms of production or/and productivity. However, the sector is in a low development stage as highlighted by a number of indicators including labor productivity, productivity gaps, trade and competitiveness, poverty and malnutrition, and infrastructure. There are however positive signals that show not only the potential for growth but also opportunities that the ADS should build upon.

Growth of agricultural GDP since the beginning of the APP (1995/96) has been slow (about 3%), highly variable from year to year, and with a slight upward trend due to stronger growth in 2011 and 2012. With a growth of population of around 2 percent over the same period, the increase in agricultural GDP per capita has been too slow to create strong dynamics leading to sustained poverty reduction and structural transformation from subsistence to commercialization.

Over the period of APP, agriculture sector (and overal economy, in general) has seen slow growth when compared to neighboring countries, most of which had considerably faster GDP growth then Nepal. 

Agriculture absorbs the majority of the labor force (61% self-employed in agriculture, 3% earning wages from agriculture) (NLSSIII, 2010/11). But this labor force is characterized by low productivity relatively to the rest of the economy. The estimate of labor productivity in agriculture in Nepal ($794/unit of agricultural labor) is about one fourth of the productivity in the rest of the economy. The weak performance of agriculture has created strong incentives for a large part of the most productive labor force (the ones in 20-40 age group) to seek employment abroad. The departure of migrants reached the level of almost 300000 in 2010.

Agricultural land per capital also decreased as the combined effect of several factors including inheritances, loss of agricultural land to urbanization, and degradation of land. Smaller size and more fragmented farms make it more difficult to realize economics of scale and also to provide sufficient livelihood for smallholder farm families. Even though GDP per hectare of cultivated land is about \$1800, the average farm size is only about 0.7 ha per household on average and more than 50% of households have farm size less than 0.5 ha. Although, it should be noted that, aggregate land productivity does not compare too badly with several neighbors of Nepal. During 2011 Nepal had 0.082 ha arable land per capita which yielded 2481 kg of cereal per hectare and fetched ADGP equivalent of \$2651 per hectare (India had \$2139 per hectare).

  ) %>%

Among several factors reported to contribute towards low productivity, low adoption of improved agricultural technology remains a key one. The productivity gap between current and potential production is significant and this related to high level of farming for subsistence, access and adoption of suitable technology (both on farm and post-harvest), availability of inputs (planting material, breeds, feed, plant and animal health protection, irrigation, electricity, finance), and limited investment in the sector. Nepal has an estimated 44.7% of agricultural entities commercialized and 55.3% under subsistence farming entities. Staple commodities such as rice, wheat, potato and vegetables have higher commercialization rates (30-50%) than maize and fruits (15-25%).

Huge productivity gaps are noticed in several subsectors of agriculture including fish (Current production: 3.6 t/ha/year, Potential production: 10 t/ha/year), timber (CP: 0.337 cum/year, PP: 13.4 cum/year), paddy (CP: 2.72 t/ha/year, PP: 10-12 t/ha/year).

One set of constraints to the realization of such potential is the availability of inputs. For example feed ingredient supply is the major input to poultry and 60% is imported at relatively high cost.

The use of chemical NPK fertilizer (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) in Nepal 2011/12 was 422,547 MT of which only about 25% is imported and officially declared to customs. This amount is sold on a subsidized rate by the state only through agricultural cooperatives. However, price does not substantially affect farmers' demand, and the other 75% is imported informally.

SRR has remained very low. Against the desirable SRR for crops at 25% to 30%, average SRR is only 4% to 8% for wheat followed by 4.4% in rice, 3.8% in maize and 1.6% for pulses.

Nepal's agricultural trade is in deficit. The growth of imports has outpaced exports and the agricultural trade deficit has increased over the years from \$124 million to \$373 million (TEPC, 2009/10). Nepal imports primary and industrial raw materials (due to declining domestic raw material production), and processed agriculture products (due to limited investment and competitiveness in high-quality, high-value agro-processing). The range of exports is concentrated in a narrow set of manufactured and agricultural products, such as carpets, ready-made garments, pashmina, handicrafts, lentils, tea, cardamom, fruit, ginger, vegetable ghee and medicinal and aromatic plant products (MAPs).

Nepal's agricultural import and export trade comprises about 15.6% of total trade, which includes items such as petroleum, construction materials, vehicles and equipment, consumer goods and others. Export value of the top three high value crops exceeds the value of cereal and diary imports.

Nepal has comparative advantages in export markets in resource- and labor-intensive low technology agriculture products such as dried vegetables, coffee, tea, vegetable and roots, ginger, and cardamom.

The Industrial Policy, 2010 has prioritized agriculture and agro-forestry industries for investment, and provides additional incentives and facilities to these industries. Foreign investment in agriculture sector (including processing and retailing) is less than 1% of total foreign investment.

The overall performance of APP has been mixed. The implementation of the APP was not helped by the conflict that plagued the country during approximately the first 10 years of the APP period. In addition to the reduced government and donors' support there are other factors that contributed to the weak performance of the APP including:

- Lack of Coordination
- Withdrawal of Subsidies on Fertilizer and Tube Wells (shallow and deep tube wells)
- Faults in the Design and Economic Assumptions of the APP
- Weak institutional capacity on project/program implementation
- Lack of Attention to Legal Issues
- Lack of Attention to Social and Geographic Inclusiveness
- Low Attention to Land Management Issues
- Inadequate Consideration of Regional Trade

Broadly, the explanation of the slow progress is based on eight sets of interrelated factors: Implementation, legal aspects, design aspects (rigid targets, simplistic view of technology, narrow green revolution perspective, emphasis on guiding inputs and outputs, lack of systems for re-planning), conflict, politics and policies, investment, capacity and human resources, and plans.

## Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS)

- Was developed by MoAD with support from technical assistance of ADB, Rastriya Kishan Sanjal (National peasants' coalition) comprising a technical team of 12 other development co-partners in preparation (IFAD, EU, FAO, SDC, JICA, AUSAID, DANIDA, WFP, DFID, USAID, WB, UN women).
- The ADS report includes a 10-year Action Plan and Roadmap and a rationale based on the assessment of the current and past performance of the agriculture sector.
- Key issues for the ADS: Productivity; competitiveness; trade; commercialization; infrastructure; credit, insurance and taxes; subsidies; land; food and nutrition security; institutions and human resources; climate change and natural resource management; social and geographic inclusion; and legal.

- Vision (7 sub heads):
  - Self reliance
  - Sustainability
  - Competition

## Ministry of Agriculture

### History

The Government of Nepal established the early form of this ministry, the Department of Agriculture, in 1952, dissolving the Agricultural Council, which was the highest governing body until that time. In 1974, the department was developed into a ministry and the portfolio of Irrigation was included resulting in the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation. After further restructuring, the Ministry of Irrigation was formed separately. It was in 1991 that the Government decided to strengthen cooperatives throughout Nepal and between 1999 and 2001, the ministry was named the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperative. When the portfolio of cooperatives was outsourced again, the ministry gained was known under the names of Ministry of Agriculture or Ministry of Agricultural Development depending on the current administration.

In 2018, under the second Oli cabinet, the portfolio of the ministry was enlarged and the portfolio of Land Management was added to the then Ministry of Agricultural Development and the portfolio of Cooperatives was returned to the ministry, while the Ministry of Land Reform and Management was discontinued.

In August 2018, the ministry's portfolio was adjusted again, due to a cabinet expansion, the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation was reopened while the agriculture-related portfolio was changed to Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development.

## Crop and livestock insurance

There is a recent realization that agriculture sector needs investment initiative from both government and private sector as well as risks and uncertainty associated with both agriculture and livestock enterprises  need to be mitigated while attracting more and more farmers to agriculture. In order to address the aforementioned setbacks Nepal government has implemented governance and economic reform working policy, 2069. Eleventh point of the policy paper outlines provision for insuring against risk in fisheries, poultry and agricultural commodities as well as for granting subsidies. "Crop and livestock insurance", formally, in a normative manner initiated from Magh 1, 2069 BS. All crop commodities currently in cultivated (Cereal, legumes, fruits, vegetable, spices and oilseed, mushroom, etc), poultry rearing, apiary and fisheries can be insured. Likewise, any other crops and livestock declared by insurance committee in the form of insurance policy can also be insured. At least 20 non-life insurance companies registered to insurance committee in Nepal have uptaken the initiative of insuring under such schemes. Each company have been assigned 3-5 districts by the insurance committee for delivery of business to the accessible service of farming communities.

- Number of insurers: 40
  - Life insurance: 19
  - Non-life insurance: 20
  - Re-insurance: 1
- Proportion of population with access to insurance service: 20%
- Government of Nepal is providing 75% as subsidy in the value of policy amount.
- **Insurer**: Registered insurance service provider companies
- **Insured**: Individual person, farming household, farmers' group or farmers' cooperative providing insurance service.
- **Insured amount**: (also called the policy amount) It is the valuation of the property that is to be insured.
- **Insurance premium**: It is the amount owed to the insurance company for accepting the risk.
- **Insurance policy**: A document issued upon agreement reached between the insurer and insured contracting the transfer or risk.

## Agriculture related Policy, Programs and future direction of the Province 3

Almost 90% of area falls in the hills and high hills. It does not contain core terai but have some agricultural flat lands in Chitwan, Makwanpur and Sindhuli. This region is high food deficit region not because small production but highly populated metropolitan like Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bharatpur lie in this province and other major cities like Hetauda Sub metropolis, Bhaktapur municipalities, Dhulikhel and Banepa also situated in the region. Thus the Land Management Agriculture and Cooperative ministry of the province has huge responsibilities of feeding its population. The per capita income of this province is highest among all provinces and provides highest share of revenues as well. Thus the demand for food in this province ischaracterized by high quantity and better quality.

It is estimated that the cereal production in the province is 699,901 Mt per year while in case of milk it is 459,702 Mt. The availability of milk is around 83 liters against the requirement of 91 litres percapita. Likewise meat and eggs availability are 19 kg and 97 pcs respectively against the requirement of 24 kg and 104 pcs per capita per annum. So the provincial ministry has declared for self sufficiency in eggs milk and meat within 1 year, 2 years and 3 years respectively (MoLAC province 3, 2018).
