### Role of Media

There is no denying the fact that media play a significant role in national affairs and national development. It not only promotes national identity and harmony but also contributes in achieving economic progress and social development. As the media touches almost every aspect of public life, its responsibility is crucial for creating, shaping and reflecting public opinion. Considered as the heart of democracy and rule of law, the media also helps nations meet various formidable contemporary challenges. Nepal has witnessed a noteworthy growth in the media sector following the restoration of democracy in 1990. The Rising Nepal's sister publication, the Gorkhapatra daily, has been a national heritage in the country's media sector. The vernacular Nepali newspaper has entered the 120th year of its launching. As a state media, the publication has seen many ups and downs since its inception on May 6, 1901 (Baisakh 24, 1958 B.S.). Despite facing a myriad of challenges, the publication has continued to serve the nation and the people

Human life is regulated by communication of which media constitute a part, a truth producing part. It is a process of learning, awareness and coordination of behaviour. It helps to visualise the life’s prospects. Media make up a union of soft power of text, image and sound to get the voice of people into the public sphere and widen the scale of their deliberation and participation in decisions. In the multi-sided process of nation building various insights, perspectives and concepts of media are useful resources to satisfy peoples’ yearning for freedom, justice and national identity. Media thus offer a marketplace of ideas to exercise choice. Their autonomy in rules, finance, professionalism and context-sensitivity enable them to freely report about the vices of Nepali society and offer options to mitigate them.

Nation building under the state’s leadership and mobilisation of civic bodies with robust technical and financial support are the most desirable gifts in a world of disarray. Modern means of communication, cultural diffusion, justice and democracy are propelling the fusion of Nepali nations into its state symbolising an epithet of public will. Now, Nepali leaders need to transmit specific interests of groups into public and national interest and socialise them to identify with Nepaliness.  It is not by the secluded tribal identity but equal citizenship that defines the Nepali state and its civic nationalism defies predators.

Its impersonal spirit can abolish feudalism and clientelism and protect citizens from alien manipulation of consciousness while producing different levels of communication through endogenous progress. Nepali nations exist in many parts of the world and communicate with each other through language, culture and civilisation. This means that spatial view alone is not enough to arrest its historicity.

Now Nepali media are gripped by a dilemma between constitutional freedom and traditional politics rooted in tribal affinity, not national affinity with the state which is a sphere of rights, solidarity and democracy. Democracy has opened a scope for multi-channel message and citizens’ feedbacks to leaders obliging them to evolve national outlook. The diversity of Nepali media has linked politics with social life - families, communities, cultural and linguistic groups, and articulated their desires so that illicit grievances do not upturn social cohesion.

Similarly, they have eased economic structures of production, exchange and distribution of public goods thus overcoming the problems of scarcity created by an imbalance of supply and demand.  The current social dynamics in Nepal based on identity politics is, however, straining civic renewal facilitated by Nepal’s many post-traditional societal traits vital to bond social capital for cultivating positive multipliers of nation-building. Some media in Nepal with distinct pattern of communication are more conducive to nation-building than the other.

Nepali media’s role in building democratic life in society, political structures and parties and crafting a strong national identity cannot be misjudged but this type of media have yet to delink violence from politics. The control of the media by partisan, corporate and geopolitical interest tends to polarise the national audience into good and evil and chip the nation’s civic culture.

Professional media grounded in public interests articulate distributive justice to foster a feeling of civic solidarity which creates general loyalty to constitutional state and adapt the old pattern of life to new stimuli and demands. They are considerate, not context free, in orientation as they help build thoughtful considerations among diverse communities, shape rational consensus and add to social cooperation by hauling positive message, information, values and issues that are essential for an educated public-policy oriented dialogue. In times of crisis they bring the connectors of society in a dialogue and synthesise diverse perspectives to fit into a national will. Nepal precisely requires a pro-active role of professional media which can foster a single public identity, equality of citizens before the law, instil civic duty to each other and close the elite-mass gap.

Enlightened media can pass civic knowledge in the entire arteries of polity, help each to bridge the space between the centre, Kathmandu and periphery and across the social classes and shore up the process of national unity. They help citizens free from fatalism, stamp out social ills of Nepali society and provide freedom from all types of tutelage. The sharing of lived experience of surviving citizens can provide learning opportunities for others to build on and strengthen resilient traits of national awareness, historical experience, crisis adaptation, revitalisation and post-conflict reconciliation.

Media freedom, in this sense, is connected to social accountability, public ethics and human rights. Likewise, pluralism in news means upholding normative standards of democracy, human rights, social justice and peace and the civic spirit of a deliberative civic culture which is vital to include the perspectives, values and interests of all sides in nation-building through diverse strategies and outreach:

The unification of people in the state promises its stability and endurance. In Nepal a gap persists between Nepali speaking, spiritually-oriented rural society and the English-stressing materially-oriented urban sub-society. This dualism, rested in a digital gap, is exposing the citizens to bumpy media socialisation and disposition without higher phase of life. Wearing away of this dualism is central to building this nation. Remote areas of Nepal demand the spur of progress indicators. Integration of the periphery to the centre, Kathmandu, requires the diffusion of media channels and effective outreach of the Nepali state so that democratic nation-building can impel from the bottom-up.

Nation building implies a process of cultivating common values, sentiments, feeling, emotion and interests across the diverse people. The split in education and health of Nepal, public and private, cuts up a critical support to under-classes and diffusion of cultural memories so crucial for political acculturation of diversity to changing times. Culture itself is a distilled knowledge shaped by communication. Nepali media must help to integrate political parties, civil society, business and citizens into a national communicative space and cultivate their loyalties to the state. So long as citizen, as members of state, is clientalised to personalised leaders building responsive capacity to state staggers. This is the reason Nepali media find difficulty to judge politics from non-partisan angle.

Self-governance is intrinsic to human genes. It is based on their self-developed consciousness about the physical space, language, culture, ancestry, history, religion and laws often reinforced by the narration of media. They together make up the nation of people. Modern nation-building requires the de-tribalisation of society and transfer of tribal, ethnic, caste, religious, regional and linguistic loyalty to the state, a .state having enough autonomy and capacity aided by its resources to determine its free existence. Tribalisation of political parties, media and civil society and their inability to imbibe civic virtues risk national cohesion in the same way as clientialisation of citizens to personalised leaders. Both cut the freedom of Nepalis and their ability to defend the hard-shell of the state within which democracy is situated.

The communicative gift of Nepalis is a key to realise their inner vigilance and ability to air voice on public matters. The free flow of information offered by the media under the Nepali constitutional right to information has made them critical of a range of issues and source of their valid judgment. Attentive citizens’ expression in the social media reflect the condition of Nepalis and their needs offering opinions, options and promises for the solution of burning problems. Politicisation of citizens with added rights but few duties has, however, made Nepali politics aspiration-driven, even some media offer radical view rather than shape credible opinion and objective reporting essential for nation-building.

Media pluralism is the hallmark of democracy but diverse media socialisation of citizens has also fragmented Nepal’s civic culture.  When news, views and analysis are assorted with parochial interests, the flow of information turns public sphere jarring. Nepali citizens are, therefore, seeking to exonerate themselves from this sordid fact and criticise the national leaders for the nation’s elongated political transition.

For nation-building Nepal has adhered the politics of social inclusion, partly multiculturalism, partly accommodation, federalism and promotional measures for weaker sections of society and quota for the marginalised. Nepal’s distributive justice is rooted in a proportional electoral system in the structure of governance. The national construction of the nation demands a workable social contract whereby the state find easy to reconcile social fissures through peace dividends where Nepali media can assume communication, aggregation and articulation roles to link the state with citizens. Nepali media’s role lies in moderating contesting views to a middle path and enables all people to use socialised choice.

The Nepali media have marked a shift from conventional watchdog role to a vibrant dialogue forum between the state and citizens. Only an interacting public sphere can draw citizens’ policy attention. They can help to moderate the behaviour of legitimate, dissident and rebellious oppositions engaged in agitation and raise the voice of those exiled into to silence. Nepali media hold the power of public to improve the health of democracy and renew the society and the state to bounce back to a better condition capable of establishing a balance between public order, freedom, justice and peace.

### Role of media duing crisis time

The COVID-19 pandemic has appeared as an unprecedented global crisis. Economic activities have shut down, social life has come to a standstill. More than the crisis, an innate psychological fear of the devastation that follows is deeply entrenched among public. With the World Health Organization already confirming that COVID-19 has affected 196 countries of the world, the gravity of the situation can be inferred. Various countries of the world have shut down with no signs of the pandemic coming to a complete halt. Although efforts are underway to find a vaccine for the cure of the virus, the real solution is looking unlikely in the near future. In this scenario, it is important that the state and citizens go hand-in-hand to minimize the adverse effect emanating from the COVID-19. The role of various state institutions including media and civil society will be pivotal to alleviate the crisis.
The manner in which the media is carrying the news and information pertaining to COVID-19 needs critical scrutiny. In our context, media seems to be creating deep confusion among the public about the real status of the coronavirus. While this is not to undermine the role of those media that are performing their duties responsibly, the issue is how to bring the entire media fraternity on track in term of abiding by the journalistic values. With an urgency to get themselves heard and seen over the rival media, some media have carried misleading headlines without verifying the source in the past few days. In the drive towards becoming first to give breaking news, some media have compromised the cardinal principles of journalism. One such case appeared this week when some media disseminated the news of a Birgunj resident being infected of the coronavirus which was later disproved by the concerned authority.
Another aspect of dissemination has to do with the choice of information and the manner of presentation. As the public is in a state of anxiety and fear during such difficult circumstances, media needs to provide content that increases optimism and hope among the public. This could in the form of making the headline news of the positive developments towards combating the coronavirus globally. Instead of reporting only the number of deaths as top news stories, successful stories of the virus treatment and the ongoing initiative towards finding a solution to this crisis can be the major headlines. Devising captivating promotional messages related to COVID-19 in a bid to generate mass awareness should continue.
Moreover, media can also carry videos of the successful treatment cases and the encouraging words of medical practitioners involved in curing the disease for public respite. Running interviews of psychotherapists and motivational speakers could alleviate the perturbed public mind. Broadcasting infotainment programmes related to history, litereature, music and sports could be interesting for the public.
Media can also support the state in its intiative towards combating the global crisis. Circulating the relentless efforts being made by the state will also serve the general welfare. Nonetheless, media as a watchdog of the state activities needs to bring into attention the public ethos. Bringing the stories of low wage laborers and other menial workers and calling for the state to address their hand-to-mouth problem could be one constructive way of media reporting during the crisis.
Since people are in self-quarantine at this hour of crisis with the government’s decision of total lockdown at least for a week now, contents related to self-introspection, happiness and family relationships among others could appeal to the common people. With the predominnce of news and information pertaining to coronavirus, breaking the monotony also requires providing some refreshing materials to entertain the audience. In doing this, media ought to cater to the interests of segmented audience – children, youths and the aged.
As WHO has rightly pointed out, ‘infodemics’- an overabundance of information which exaggerates the severity of the problem and makes the solution difficult have posed a severe threat in the battle against the deadlly COVID-19. The need of a responsible journalism is all time high at the moment.

### Role of ICTs in Economic Growth

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), in the simplest way possible, can be defined as all the devices, applications and systems that allow people and organisations to interact in and with the digital world.

It is evidenced by case studies of various nations that ICTs can contribute to the national GDP and help improve market competitiveness of a country’s goods and services. ICTs also have a positive impact on a country’s governance and promote its international economic integration, improve living standards, narrow inequality and improve the utilisation of natural resources. All these functions of ICTs make it a key player in the 21st century in enhancing the economic growth of developing countries; because ICTs can help them make up for what they lack in industrial resources by catching up to the developed world in terms of information. This importance is also reflected in the fact that most of the countries today have national "e-strategies" and donor agencies routinely invest in them.

Now, in developing countries, there are mainly two ways in which ICTs contribute to economic growth. One is through their manufacturing and another is through their use. As ICTs are a combination of various individual technological entities, they require manufacturing. And most of this manufacturing is outsourced by the developed countries to the developing countries. This point can be illustrated by the examples of China and India. China is the manufacturing hub for Apple and India is the country which handles the software designing and packaging work outsourced by Microsoft. Such process of outsourcing helps provide decent jobs to thousands of people in the developing countries thus, contributing to poverty reduction.

Also, such companies not only bring their jobs but also their knowledge, which they impart on to the workers of the developing countries. This equips the labour force with skills which means that even if the outsourcing companies were to leave, the people would have necessary skills and expertise to get a job somewhere else or even start their own ventures. All of these serve to make the economy more productive and efficient – delivering economic growth.

Furthermore, setting up manufacturing points and industries in the developing countries means paying taxes to these countries which will directly contribute to the GDP and GNP. Also, we know that industries and especially ICT industries are not isolated entities but part of a larger value chain. Thus, the impacts mentioned above do not stay limited to one sector but branch to multiple sectors; all contributing simultaneously to the economic growth of a nation.

Then there is the act of buying and selling. ICTs, regardless of their place of manufacture, often always find their way into the markets of the developing countries where they are bought and sold. And just this simple act of exchange generates millions of dollars in revenue to the governments depending on the size of the market. This revenue is economic growth. This is how the physical aspects of ICTs help deliver economic growth in the developing countries.

But aside from these physical aspects, there is also the economic growth brought on by the use/application of ICTs. This can best be described through the following "five routes to economic growth:"

Economy: ICTs vastly increase the access to data and information crucial to the supply chain, at significantly reduced costs. Such increased data greatly increases the entrepreneurial activities of a country, thus increasing the efficiency and productivity. All of these end up promoting economic growth.

Efficiency: The use of ICTs can make an entire nation more efficient. The production sector becomes efficient as a labour force comprised of human activity complimented by technology becomes faster, longer and much more diligent than a solely human staff. Also, ICTs when adopted at the state level brings about "e-governance" which brings transparency, accountability and greatly streamlines the often-painstaking bureaucracy of the developing countries. This reduces corruption and makes entrepreneurial activities much simpler by removing the middlemen and the time-consuming hassles. Also, the need to make repeated lengthy journeys for activities such as meetings, ordering, delivering etc. is also reduced as ICTs bring about journey substitution. These, in turn, not only energise domestic commercial activity but also attract foreign investment. Thus, enlarging and enhancing the economy.

Profitability: When the cost of input decreases and the process becomes efficient then the output produced is of high quality. This output can then be sold at a high-value market (the information about which is also obtained from ICTs). Add to that, a transparent and corruption-free process, as discussed above, and this greatly increases the profitability of produced goods of a nation. This also helps in delivering economic growth.

Upgrading: Upgrading is changing the production process from a lower value to higher value ones. ICTs also help in this. With the use of ICTs, a business can take itself online where it may be able to expand its coverage area by getting more orders from different places. ICTs can also play a role in delivering these orders with technologies like drones being employed for the purpose. The payment process is also greatly modernised with various e-payment platforms being utilised. Thus, the whole process gets upgraded in value.

Restructuring: Restructuring means a shift of resources from a lower productive sector to a higher productive one. As discussed in the points above, ICT makes many sectors of the economy highly productive while at the same time, it opens up completely new sectors of production. Thus, investment of resources can be concentrated in these sectors which will yield maximum benefits for the economy of developing countries.

Thus, with the cost of inputs significantly decreased, production streamlined, outputs yielding higher profits, previously low-value sectors upgraded and entirely new sectors opened up for investments, this is how ICTs help deliver economic growth in developing countries.

However, this is not an unlimited scope and ICTs do have limitations, especially in the area of information failures. In ICTs, all routes to economic growth pass through the domain of information and unfortunately, this very domain of information is limited in developing countries by five types of information failures, namely absence, poor quality, uncertainty, asymmetry and cost of information.

Absence of information means that the key information that the development actors need such as the population of a place, literacy rate, sex ratio, livelihood data, internet penetration rate etc. are not available or at least the means to obtain such information are not available. Poor quality of information means that even if the information is available, they may not be of the required quality and usually not in an open format. Uncertainty of information suggests that the information may be available and may be of the desired quality but still, the accuracy of it may be questionable in developing countries; as most of the time the methodology will not be adequately given and the data collection and analysis procedure will not be clearly elaborated. Then, there is the problem of asymmetry where some development actors have access to key information that others lack. And due to the lax regulations and implementation in developing countries, such actors who do have the information start acting as middlemen and use that information for power and profit instead of passing it on to others and acting as facilitators for the economic growth.

And even if none of these information failures exist and quality and reliable information is available to all in an open format, even then, access to such information would be hindered by the cost. Many developing countries are still struggling to lift significant portions of their population out of poverty, the slightest bit of cost associated with information, such as the cost of travel, bureaucracy etc. will prevent people from accessing it.

Therefore, with the I (information) component of ICT facing such severe restraints, the role that ICTs can play in delivering economic growth in developing countries becomes limited.

But, all in all, it is of no doubt that ICTs have a significant role to play in delivering and accelerating economic growth. In the developing countries, this role becomes even more vital as they have tried and failed to do so with more traditional means. ICTs can be utilised in a two-pronged approach to bring growth to countries.

Firstly, the setting up of industries for their manufacture and the market activity generated by their consumption generate direct revenue to the government and also generate thousands of direct and indirect jobs.

Secondly, the use of ICTs helps facilitate start-ups and other entrepreneurial activities which have a broad impact on the whole value chain and contribute to poverty alleviation. ICTs reduce the costs of input and make the production process cheaper and more efficient. Thus, more value can be levied on the output which in turn makes the business profitable. Multiply these individual effects by thousands of businesses employing ICTs and then we get a macro-level national economic growth.
