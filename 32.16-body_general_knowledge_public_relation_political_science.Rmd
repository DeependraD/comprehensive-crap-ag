## Governance

### Shift to Poly-centric governance

The concept of governance has emerged from the incubus of neo-institutionalism following non-performance of formal institutions, lean state defended by neo-liberalism and the surge of new public management. They all treat the lumbering state as a burden and democracy as a means of selecting leaders to govern. Governance is about the exercises of power by a network of actors for the proper disposition of public affairs and rational distribution of normative and material public goods which are institutionally embedded. Nepal's stable future rests on the concertation of the nation's diverse actors' sphere of competence for the creation of a good society. Balancing rival interests and setting the congruence of Nepali state and cross-national dealings of its societal actors underlie their efficiency.


Tension arises when one actor clocks the other's choice and denies the public access to policymaking flaking leaders' will to respond to problematic situation and sapping its vital authority to set Nepali aspiration of nation-building and stress of global geopolitics in a balance. Democratic rule can improve framework condition by equal treatment of people and by cutting trade-offs between economic growth and equity, popular aspiration and constitutionalism and political ideals and human condition.

For long, bad governance hanging around the state power in Nepal pushed the nation in the backwater and frozen the public hope of prosperity. Good governance assumed vital importance now for the nation's recovery from disorder, disruption and illiberal fiddling. A critical factor shaping the performance of Nepali governance rests on its ability to mend the society's web and steer public and private institutions for the promotion of public welfare. It presumes Nepali leaders to recapture their long-abandoned policy sovereignty and revive parliament's right and the state's authority to execute constitution, strengthen local structures and manage social change.

It is equally important to coordinate donors' multi-purpose and multi- directional governance projects for "policy coherence" and their harmony with national priorities. Both can capacitate local bodies with the ample supply of civil servants, money, technology, infrastructures and co-ordination works. But, as long as partisan distribution of constitutional and other public posts endures, stable balance in provision and production, exchange and distribution, supply and demand, import and export and business profit and human life remains an uphill task. Public interest orientation demands the embeddedness of governance in society while synergy of progress entails renewing civic virtues from the bottom-up.

 Paradigm shift: The associational revolution shifted the power and authority of mono-centric government to poly-centric governance. Three key poles of governance are the state, market and all intermediary institutions, networks and movements lumped as civil society governed by diffused interests. The success of their tasks rests on communication and coordination of diverse choices. A shared rule where each supports the other's competence averts anarchy. Nepali government as an executive wing of state deals national "politics" and represents its imperatives. The governance is de-territorialised reflecting diverse interests acting across multiple spheres of "policy" including parallel set of international regimes of which the nation is a member. Causes and effects of creed, greed and grievances of regional and global in scope, however, cannot be dealt by the Nepali actors only. Solution entails multi-actor collaboration in the life-world and shared benefits.

The duty-based organic civil society of Nepal, imbued with rich social capital, is desired to offset the utilitarian impulse of politicians and businessmen and fix all interests in the middle path through their optimization.  The reawakening of public sphere can modify individual preference and set new checks on power above Nepali state's institutional complex- the axis of legislative, executive and judiciary authorities. But the self-ironies of right-based civil society and NGOs have reduced them in the margin of power lacking conduit to influence authorities and turning their misdeeds a high cost venture. Business sector of Nepal, however, possess high leverage as they finance politicians, influence policy, skew economic decision and gain illicit benefits using instrumental criteria of efficiency.

Goals and principles of governance: Governance is an array of goal-oriented policy processes, such as national security for the creation of a relatively safe environment, rule of law, voice of people and their access to justice, civic participation in social and economic life, delivery of public goods and conflict mitigation. Securing the dignity of Nepali people requires cohesive promotion of these goals. Governance can become effective if economic activities are organised around these goals, social, economic and political actors become conscious of their duties, acquire contextual learning and behavioural change. Nepal has accepted civil society, ancillary organs of political parties, local federations, etc. as legitimate actors to bring the voice of public in policy making.

Nepalis' power to self-organise and converse their interests rests on civic capacity of mediating bodies to supply soft power of ideas, lower the cost of cooperation and enable the leaders to grasp the state's potentials such as strategic geography, hydropower, youth population, tourism, cultural capital and heritage of tolerance to plan the nation's long-term future. An effective response to the demands of people and those of outside actors is crucial for the adaptation of all national actors-security, power nexus, regulatory, elite circulating, integrity maintainer, cultural industries and institution of production and circulation enabling them to get along to changing global political economy. Too much party-mindedness of top leaders has, however, battered the efficacy of public institutions in Nepal while impunity stained financial discipline, tax, tariffs and foreign aid aimed at filling saving, investment and foreign exchange gaps. 

Solution of Nepali people's many problems calls for collaborative efforts at multi-actor levels on the background of the post-conventional ethics of governance whose cardinal principles are: legitimacy, integrity, transparency, accountability, efficiency and equity. Each element presumes the other to complement, not compete and counter. Civil servants, planners and political leaders of Nepal are accountable for their policy choices and the course of actions because they are charged with the tasks of service delivery. People judge whether the power is rightly exercised and legitimate order is attained for the promotion of mutual gains. This can minimize free-riders, corrupts, criminals and conflict actors that flourish in predation, economic monopoly, capital flight, syndicate and patronage depriving the common Nepalis of a chance to rise socially and use their sovereignty. Means of governance are as vital as goals and values. Order can exist without justice but justice cannot be attained in a power vacuum and public order deficit.

 Art of governance: The art of governance assumes: consensus-orientation of actors, information exchange among them, policy coordination, coherence of behaviour, feedback, steering national policies and collective action. As a nation caught in diverse hierarchy, Nepali authorities need multidisciplinary skills to cope with pressures and claims from "insider" groups such as bargaining union of civil servants, elected authorities, several inclusive commissions, national human rights commission and federations to various "outsider" groups such as business chambers, ethnic associations, class organisations, women's movement to human rights NGOs, which as right-based bodies, demand Nepal's consistency to universal standards. Beyond constitutional duty of collective identity of citizenship, they converse on global values flouting national roots of enlightenment. Self-organisation of these groups in Nepal has enlarged their capacity for collective action.

A correct disposition of power in Nepal requires coordination of  all  constitutional bodies, private sector and civil society, orient them to constitutional spirit and beef up national integrity system so that costs for deviants are high than compliance to rule. Since Nepal's discourse on politics, power and policy is gaining attention, learning about the tasks of federal, provincial and local bodies is crucial to ramp up the their capacity to deliver public goods to the people. Nepali think tanks should focus on policy networks instead of being fixed on the structure and powers of state agencies while leaders must pay attention to the demands of people, lobby for their interest, support  governance goals, check the illicit behaviour of those in power and uphold due diligence on corporate power so that they don't corrupt lawyers, economists and journalists in defence of supply-side economy which sets the social equity subordinate to the control of powerful interest groups and coils the self-correcting device of democratic governance.

### Governance Transformation

Nepal is in the midst of a great transformational moment brought by an opportunity to compete, collaborate and connect with various scales of actors. Institutional restructuring of national and local bodies, mobility of vast number of labour force abroad, adaptation to modern technology, urbanisation, globalisation and climate change are drivers of transformation. The new narrative in Nepal is happy life, prosperity and stability. The self-rule of local governance structures in Nepal is the foundation to realise this vision. It is relatively autonomous with new types of civic, legislative, executive and judicial authority. The electoral politics of middle path is opened to reason and resolution of conflicts from the bottom up where women's leadership is predominant.

The Constitution of Nepal has authorised Gaunpalikas and municipalities to direct, control and conduct their own affairs and assume roles on education, health and sanitation, safe drinking water, communication, agriculture, irrigation, industry, animal husbandry, upliftment of woman and targeted groups, right to collect reasonable tax and engage in infrastructure development, planning, monitoring and evaluation, etc. Wards are the lowest units having a strong sense of caring community and shared identity that spawns democratic leadership, citizenship duties and governing. The new transformation in the structures, functions and roles of local bodies has, however, stifled the performance of elected local bodies owing to learning by doing approach. The ties between the federal, province and local levels are based on the principles of cooperation, coexistence and coordination. They are vital to settle the contending interests between the provinces and the local bodies, attain the transformation of the nation from poverty to welfare and prosperity and create civic culture worthy of Nepalis' civic heritage.

The hope of Nepalis from the local government is stifled by delays in many areas: adjustment of civil servants, required laws by federal and provincial governments, physical infrastructures, determination of local tax and skilled personnel for governance. The normal functions and service delivery in remote areas are stymied by the absence of civil servants, their low morale and increasing partisan prejudice. The Ministry for Federal Affairs and General Administration unveiled that local bodies need 37,000 civil servants which it is fulfilling through a fast track method of Public Service Commission exam. The State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the parliament pointed out the inability of civil servants to adapt to political changes suggesting their transparent work evaluation and accountability to the tasks.

Absence of laws to regulate shared rights and jurisdiction of federal, provincial and local bodies punch their responsiveness. Restructuring of many Gaun Palikas and municipalities and merger of many local units expanded their sizes and devolved many district offices on functional areas without infrastructural preconditions and the scale of public economy. The District Coordination Committee faces difficulty in coordinating diverse local actors in matters of balanced development. Expansion of local infrastructures spurs economic growth, employment opportunity, cut poverty and widen the access of marginalised citizens in development outcome.

Economic modernisation and institutional set-up in the rural areas drive spatial diffusion of growth of small enterprises based on locational advantage and dispersed resource potentials- hydro, tourism, herbals, agriculture, animal husbandry, etc. To add stimulus to employment generation Prime Minister Employment Scheme offers a conditional grant of Rs. 10 million to local bodies and set the guidelines to the targeted youths in addition to other grants from National Fiscal Commission, Local and Federal Consolidated Funds defined as conditional, special, complementary and financial equalisation and provincial aid set to unleash rational progress.

The Nepali government has issued a directive to set up good governance committee at local level, aiming to represent functional interest groups of society in public deliberation on integrated development planning - setting priorities, public hearing, formulation of plans and programmes, budget allocation, operation and monitoring and evaluation of development in a transparent, judicious and accountable manner. A rational planning can ensure livelihood and uplift Nepalis' standards. Local elected bodies are largely inclusive in terms of representation of woman, Dalits or minority groups and hold transformatory potential in politics as it discards the caste, class and gender walls that subordinate one Nepali to the other. The representation of local functional interest groups such as chamber of commerce and industries, civil society, NGOs, trade unions, human rights bodies, Consumer Groups, journalists and voluntary associations can make them more deliberative in democracy, shape civic habits and build multi-scale interface transforming inherited rural society into self-chosen one.

They are critical mass of transformation and checks and balances of power. The locally elected chief coordinates the functions of Good Governance Committee. The authority and legitimacy of local government springs from elections. But there are non-government, semi-government, federations, cooperatives, civil society, business, voluntary and non-elected ones whose dominant culture is social inclusion, mutual aid and solidarity and whose decisions on functional areas affect the lives of Nepalis. Therefore, optimisation of interactions among them can improve the level of engagement and commitment in performance in the politics of common good and steer their tasks performances. In others, committee system has to be mobilized to build their capacity to effectively deliver.

The sovereignty of Nepal lies in its citizens, therefore, their participation in local decisions affecting them has become the fulcrum of democratic governance. The rationale of this good governance committee is to foster ethically designed governance, make service delivery people-friendly, organise inclusive deliberation of multi-stakeholders providing them ownership in the policy and share global knowledge, skills and technological innovation thus lowering the costs of transformation.

Since the habitat of politics is the state, Nepali political leaders need to take initiative to resolve the maladies of local bodies: tussles between chair and vice-chair persons, ineffectiveness of judicial committee on dispute settlement, corruption, abuse of public budget to buy luxury items, ineffectiveness of monitoring committee, etc. affecting the distribution of social security benefits and hampering development. These maladies ruin financial discipline and integrity and weaken the social contract. Election of contractors, middle men, owner of dozer, NGOs, businessmen, etc. cultivate predatory practices for collusion with technocrats to gobble up resources abusing the virtue of political power against the vices of structural injustice.

Legislators' interest in the executive domain of constituency building fund and lobby to increase the amount from Rs 40 million to 100 million for each legislator than legislation making has cut the development prerogative of local government, fostered patronage and made Nepali parliament weak to sustain power balance. The abuse of this money spoils the civic spirit. The increasing municipalisaion of Nepali society is shifting the migration pattern from rural areas to urban nodes and abroad. It is opening economic innovation, newer settlement, occupying newer lands and management for livelihood. This is transforming the scale of politics and the public spheres creating opportunity for social mobility and mixing clan-based community into syncretic one with better life with modern amenities.

This has produced a hybrid poly-culture but created difficulty in retaining youth force to rural households vital to lift transformed life. In the hills social cost of migration is huge. Only women, elderly people and children are left for subsistence farming. A strategy for alleviating misery through the modernisation of means of production through the use of macroeconomic tools of planning intervention is must to enable Nepali society to adapt to new age of acceleration. The egalitarian vision of Nepali Constitution incarnates social justice as a trait of transformation. It opposes cultic honouring of leadership with a heavy load of garlands in the public affronting the concept of popular sovereignty. The key challenge of Nepal's local bodies is effective governance especially in service delivery to improve the image of democracy and build trust among ordinary citizens, elected authorities and civil servants. This trust is central to improve the living standards of Nepal is affirming that democracy is better than any other type of polity.

Here provision, production and policy functions on exchange of public goods and distributive justice are vital to ignite social spirit of Nepalis as a basis of civil society and set the primacy of law over the privileges of elites flourishing in impunity. Without economic discipline it is difficult to bridge the gap between lofty ideals of local democracy and its outcome for the ordinary citizens. Democratisation of political, corporate and bureaucratic instinct of utility maximization and motivating them to respond to the aspirations of Nepalis can cut social vices, foster civic culture and liberate economic conclaves controlled by a few families against egalitarian spirit.

Sustainable progress demands common commitment of federal, provincial and local governments on basic public goods such as management of ecology, security, rule of law, health, education, food, clothing, voice and social opportunities to participate in public affairs, proper utilisation of dispersed natural resources and use of new technologies for inclusive transformation. Local production of essential needs through the modernisation of agriculture especially improving seeds, irrigation and investment in fertilizer factories, productive employment in diversified enterprises meeting the home market and import-substitution that can replace imported goods can enhance transformative prospects. Nepal's adaptation to climate change needs creating local institutions that monitors the undue abuse of nature, participation of local citizens and local management of natural resources linked to both livelihood and ecological resilience.

The laws endow responsibilities to local bodies in disaster preparedness, mitigation to resilient rebuilding. Local party leaders with their vital links with central and provincial politicians, civil servants and civil society can help build consensus on democratic progress, work for the outreach of programmes to targeted groups, build legal awareness of elected representatives, protect public property and fill the vacuum created by the dissolution of Local Peace Committees for durable peace. Representative political institutions and those functional interest groups constituted by citizens themselves must embody democratic accountability where no one blocks the collective action on public interest while facilitates the service delivery. Local democracy can take roots if coordination among the actors and institutions towards the goals of local governance musters the synergy of all actors of governance in the transformative prospect of better life.

### The Essence of Freedom

The desire of human soul for aham asmi, liberty, freedom and emancipation, is an age-old and vitally attractive pursuit. It has embellished consciousness in both inner and outer spheres of life. Philosophical literatures describe the multi-dimensionality of human life and study of entire spectrum reveals how human freedom is constituted and vital for democracy, development and peace and why citizens need freedom to do what is morally just and right. Modern interpretation of life is self-defining, self-expressing and self-articulating, an end in itself, not in reference to only cognitive and affective bond with the nation, polity, parties or leadership. The history of citizens' struggle for freedom helped overcome their subordinated status. In this sense, freedom is intrinsically linked to equality. It is used to deconstruct and reconstruct human labor, society, political parties, polity and the state to set out for promised harbor of human dignity. Freedom is a condition whereby citizens uphold the power to think, speak and act as per the use of universal reason as a sovereign subject and change the society in a desirable course.

Rights-based political culture, however, only helps organised groups of society. Nepal's society, economy and polity are mainly informal and unorganised and, therefore, realisation of their constitutional rights is a necessity for freedom. This means informal society of Nepal must have equal access to the institutional resources of the state, private sector, civil society and international regime. Law based on public reason provides Nepali citizens to question the irrational aspects of human conduct and enable them to communicate problems in the public sphere and exercise legislative power via democratic will. The use of freedom in the life of Nepalis rests on their capacity of self-learning and reflection about the condition of life, organisation--building for solidarity and engagement in a shared public action not just in the spheres of production, consumption, exchange and distribution but also in the sphere of sustainability of nature and stable functions of life. The rational spirit of enlightenment alone is not enough if it does not harness long-term survival strategies, espouses a canon critical of the domination of life-world and awakens Nepali citizens to the integrity of its national culture. The ability of Nepali nation and citizens to compete in functional universality can enlarge the domain of freedom beyond constitutional state and animate the greater visibility of national life.

Full-scale operation of self-governance in Nepal can add to collective freedom while real separation of powers can give more autonomy to judiciary, media and civil society to protect freedom of citizens. Active citizenship based on a strong conscience helps them to become autonomous whereby intrinsic good sense disciplines blind passion of elites for the domination of non-elites through the instrumental use of reason. The concept of citizenship is based on holistic sense of membership of Nepali state and cannot be reduced to only a caste, class, gender, consumer, voter or labor dimensions that relativize the sovereignty inherent in them, compress the areas of national sentiment and limit their freedom. Active citizenship liberates them from feudalism, dynasticism, tutelage, negation and subordination and even ideological indoctrination which smacks of determinism and nauseating conformity, not the cultivation of freedom. It has splinted educated Nepalis in public debate suppressing the real birth of informed public opinion. The symbolic representation of adversarial politics in Nepal defined by a code of friend and foe where political power is utilized for more power in a vicious way has created a situation of perpetual anomie resulting from modernity's loss of social compassion. The inclusiveness of ideology alone can reduce the prospect for binary conflict and breathe the aspirations of Nepalis for freedom. Citizenship in Nepal presumes the extension of democracy in every sphere of life. Gautam Buddha and Immanuel Kant have rightly argued that human beings cannot be reduced to other human beings' means. Both define the concept of freedom in inner vigilance and middle path encapsulated in a moral balance between individual liberty and public duty. It is expected to revive the hope of moderates from anomaly.

In a pluralistic society like Nepal, freedom is naturally norm and law-bound, not anomic and lawless which leads to an anarchy of free wills of powerful interest groups and cuts the ability of citizens to achieve fulfilling life. For citizens of Nepal freedom is not only inherited from its history to assume present constitutional goals but also of the goal of the future society as well in response to the ever-changing social stratification and social division of labour brought by technology, self-transformation from pre-rational to rational being, Nepal's constitutional ideal of social democracy and humanitarian obligations. The source of freedom, however, rests on an awareness of constitutional and human rights and duties and lifts the burden of scarcity. This implies that acculturation in a culture of freedom seeks a harmony with the principles of democracy which provides adequate opportunity for participation, liberation of productive forces of Nepali society and self-management of economic enterprises. This can address the problem of swollen unemployment of Nepali youths who are driven to different destinations to meet their necessity.

Lawless freedom stokes the virtue of strong which corrodes legal and institutional constraints on their behaviour, weakens the ability of Nepalis to live together in peaceful existence and satisfy existential needs of all. This is why Nepali constitution is designed to control the tyranny of majority and confiscatory form of distributional struggle of minority through a system of property rights. The Constitution supposes freedom based on the foundation of citizenship equality and protective and promotive form of social justice and positive discriminations. Both the concepts are supposed to create an egalitarian society in the public sphere, a sphere where unreasonable use of power and wealth is criticised for reforms and the power of civil society, media and constitutional bodies are utilised for the rationalisation of Nepalis' life and public institutions. But to achieve this, the institutions of enlightenment must be public, broad-based and impartial which can be a passport for material prosperity. The immunity rights of Nepali citizens are couched in negative freedom which limits the authority of regime. A rough sense of equality rests on fulfilling existential needs of Nepali citizens and aspiration for freedom specific to democracy so that they are not dictated by what Karl Marx calls daily "necessity" for survival, "alienation" from their own products and "exploitation" by powerful elites using coercive means, policies and institutions. For Buddha and Marx, freedom requires the abolition of structural injustice and creation of an equal chance for all. Freedom erodes when leaders have conflicting ends.

Freedom espoused by Nepal's constitution is not libertarian in nature which seeks to weaken order-creating structures, nor classical socialistic one where the state controls individual freedom and commanding height of entire political economy but of social democratic in nature-where freedom is accompanied by accountability to social justice. It is here popular sovereignty and the state sovereignty finds a judicious harmony. It is possible only in a welfare state that socialist ideas can catch on, not in a rentier or extractive state, as it does not formulate policies as per constitutional spirit. But Nepalis must have the ability to exercise their inner conscience and outer form of constitutional rights without any dictation and manipulation from others. The history of Nepal symbolises eternal struggle of Nepalis for personal and national freedom of will and recognition. Nepali constitution does not intend to totalise and homogenise entire social and cultural diversity of the nation but recognises the unity in diversity, where each requires accepting the others and supporting them in the alleviation of their suffering. It enhances the domain of freedom for the oppressed. Poor Nepalis cannot exercise freedom if their condition of labour, life, education and institutions remains untransformed and identity is based on contradiction rather than common background condition of multiple identity groups to live with shared Nepali nationality and become aware of the social and spiritual links. Democracy cannot become functional if its intrinsic parts are weak and uncoordinated to act in the general will of Nepalis. The corporate structures of the state administration, business and civil society in Nepal need integration to the spirit of national public life. Liberation of Nepalis' potential is a key to their participation in national life and gain access to channels of appeal, attention and purposeful action which elevates upland of freedom.

Absence of preconditions for freedom creates a condition for the uncertainty of ordinary Nepali life. Modern mind is, therefore, engaged in the pursuit of vigilance, deliberation, participation and public action. The availability of positive freedom (good life) is highly correlated with sound human development index where Nepali leadership has to struggle hard to improve the better quality of life of citizens and higher level of freedom. Negative freedoms are related to non-intervention by the institutions of coercion. Nepalis can be better off if safety, wellbeing and choices are guaranteed. Socially satisfied citizens can enjoy good life-choices and generational mobility and reciprocity. Better existential condition can enhance the prospect of freedom and make life meaningful and exciting. Liberty and emancipation are not only matters of the left and the right politics in Nepal. Both should aim to address the hierarchy of human needs, rights and concerns and remove fatalism and reaction as per the constitutional spirit.

Democracy and modernity have unleashed many emancipatory ideals- rights, freedom, justice, solidarity, eco-balance and peace. They are changing the value complexes of Nepali society prompting citizens to demand an end to the utility of mindless violence in politics. This has many sided effects in Nepali society from family life, child rearing, education, health, care economy to the humanisation of multi-level governance. The constitution of Nepal aims to bridge the gap between the ideal of freedom and reality of scarcity of public goods. The political life in Nepal is, therefore, hovering around domination and contestation for the creation of a rational public order that includes the free and equal participation of Nepalis in the institutional life of the nation and experience a new lease of life.

### Power of Civic Education

Life's progress rests on continuous learning. Civic education answers the aim of life-enlightenment. It allows attaining self-illumination to combat all kinds of subordination- familial, economic, political, religious, institutional and communicative one and gain guts for freewill. It unchains Nepali citizens from the absurdity of indoctrination, thought control, consent manufacturing and false consciousness and promotes critical faculty of judgment. Conscious citizens exercise dignity and autonomy in public affairs and build good character. Nepalis of all generations need civic education to widen their democratic desire. It transforms passive people into active citizens, aids them to exercise constitutional rights and duties, bridges the gap between knowledge and wisdom, makes social contract implementable and amplifies valid voting turn out in the elections. Nepali state promises a good life to citizens by means of instilling enduring positive values of liberty, justice, tolerance, solidarity and cooperation. The legal equality of Nepalis has created a basis for active citizenship to fight for factual equality vital for the level playing field for civic participation at villages and towns. Both nurture a perspective to envision Nepal from the native viewpoint. It frees the captive minds that deem all ills of the nation to natives by enabling them to learn the utility and limits of universal knowledge to national condition.

Reflective Consciousness: Constitutional knowledge bears positive impacts on the behaviour of citizens enabling them to act constitutionally for ordered life and restyle civic culture worthy of oneness of humanity. Nepali leaders' duty lies in educating the union of the sovereignty of the state and popular sovereignty enabling them to use it. The legitimacy to rule is derived from free and fair election which allows the circulation of new leadership in power inducing rational change. Constitutional ideals provide Nepalis an orientation to reform their condition, assist acculturation to public morale, prepare for civic duties and build their patriotic character without being biased to humanitarian norms. In a multi-cultural society like Nepal, citizens' active engagement in civic associations that dot the free landscape is crucial for social and national integration. Experience about civic virtues animates a balance of the leaders' use of democratic concepts and ordinary citizens' richness in the nation's philosophical, historical, cultural and spatial life. The praxis of civic education in Nepal entails building dynamic relation of politics to citizen's life and cultivating civic sense to beat petty infantilism, eternal paternalism and arrogant juvenility of undemocratic leaders. It critically informs the authority of parents, teachers, leaders and priests instilling a belief that they are neither divine nor finer in wisdom. The use of despotic doctrine of necessity and too much personalisation of authority dehumanise the citizens and reduce them into an object of manipulation like instrumental approach adopted by a few donors to foment social fissures. Both do not train people into citizenship and reveal common ground for conflict mitigation. The noise of foreign meddling without naming the country reflects leaders' fear while handy to bend Nepali citizens' right to know. Public security is vital to vitalise citizens to critique on authorities' dilemma and venture far and wide across the cultures and national geography to symbolically bind all Nepalis in their common identity. It nullifies the challenge to the unity of state by internal forces of class, caste, ethnicity, gender, religion and region and external meddling.

Leaders' reflection on the Nepali society's diversity opens the possibility of feedback from many mini publics and facilitates them to learn from citizens about the way to resolve the practical problems of personal and national life. This can contribute to perfect their inter-subjective skills, broaden cross-cultural understanding and strengthen citizens' attachment with the Nepali state. Improved rationality of political practices can build a national consensus for constitutional, political and policy coherence on the basis of changing popular mandate. The concepts underlined in the structural and normative details of the Constitution, such as directive principles, separation of power, checks and balances, constitutional and human rights, rule of law, autonomy of constitutional bodies and cultural industries, social justice, welfare state, human security for all the citizens etc, animate self-consciousness for ample civic actions—cleaning house, road, toilets, school compound, controlling domestic violence, girl's education, safety of disables, creating green parks, health awareness, deference to elders, education about local government, etc.

Civic education is both a top-down and bottom-up socialization of human nature. This means learning contents should be mutually decided by citizens, teachers and leaders. It is process of mutual liberation, not domestication of citizens and denationalization of experts devoid of national feeling and insight of history. Democratic space exists within the nation-state. If Nepali state loses control over its citizens owing to migration of youth, immigration of outsiders and economic, social and political matters to global forces, the order of democracy shrinks from the shortage of critical masses of change agents of society. This brings an authority crisis for the government and loyalty pattern of citizens to the state, political parties, parliament and the actors of governance imposing problems for the institutionalisation of democracy. Institutions of governance fail to remain inclusive if the vision of building Nepali nation cannot address key challenges: alleviating poverty, job-creation, ending social exclusion, combating political alienation and the ecological, social, gender and inter-generational justice as they are related to the realisation of subjective and objective rights and escape from the fear of natural selection of life.

Civic Competence: A live discourse enables both leaders and citizens to gain self-confidence and know as to how their "negative rights" have inspired the democratic struggle, the state protected the heritage of the nation's syncretic culture and equipped the citizens with the muscle to shape and reminisce the screen of national history that they and their institutions, such as political parties, media, civil society and a host of associations, often reconstituted. Democracy becomes tedious if its discourses freeze in the public mind leaving the leadership free to interpret democracy, progress and peace in their own way, like in Nepal, and foster empirical divisions of society for identity politics at the cost of Nepali identity. A culture of silence, fatalism and apathy of citizens is the lethal sign of democratic debit while eternal stir radicalizes the society and erodes the pivot of democratic centre.

The basic values of citizenship lie in paying tax, becoming law-abiding, remaining vigil and assuming duty in community action. Citizenship, as a member of state, begins with commitment to and respect for state sovereignty and territorial integrity, national language, anthem, national flag and social harmony in a spirit of solidarity among all the members of Nepali state irrespective of religious, racial, linguistic, class, caste and gender diversities. Deep internalisation of the values of citizenship by leaders desists from commercialising public goods under the gyration of post-modernism and market and dialectical materialism. They detach citizens from their legendry bond to land, culture and nature. An ideology-bound education blinds one to native reality. Civic education is a program with sovereign citizens, not passive patients, clients, ignorant, aliens and objects. Democratic construction of citizenship in Nepal is vital to make political system functional. It empowers them to select workable choices that the polity offers and constantly feeds their power of feeling, thinking, working and creating the lot the Nepali nation lives by.

Political Acculturation: Nepalis since old days have created and transmitted their syncretic cultures and values across generations. Now, they seek a solution to the problem of a clash among political rationality of democracy, the economic rationality of the market and ideological rationality of social engineering that deconstructs its culture, national heritage, history and society and makes citizens rootless without any harbour to its ancient roots of enlightenment. If ethical and cultural values that bond Nepalis are torn, all that is left to power fails to represent citizens and the power of leaders becomes disproportional to their representation. In this situation, Nepali state has to ensure regulatory frame that fits to all citizens. Cognitive service to citizens enables them to judge the action of their leaders on the basis of value criteria of democracy, human rights, social justice and peace. They also need a mass of stable civic bodies to ensure a balance in the polity and bind them all, even the minorities, on the policies of Nepali state. Mutual trust and concern for fellow citizens help those who are lacking a bit deep for their dignified life mainly the weakest members. If rights of Nepali citizens remain unenforceable, like party manifestoes, the rational vision of Nepali society spins absolute impossibility. The vital task ahead for Nepali polity is to bridge the rising hiatus in the words and deeds of national preachers, teachers and leaders and saving democracy from its performance crisis. This presupposes the utilisation of the art of civic education to communicate the common heritage of the nation with a larger spectrum of people, detribalise them and enable them to exercise the power of the public for synergy of good governance.

### Development governance

The sole objective of Nepal's development strategy has been to set forth as to achieve prosperity, development and happiness of the people within a short span of time. The prime minister, ministers and political leaders are all harping on the theme of development, prosperity and happiness time and again. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has made a repeated plea to the investors to put in their resources in the development of the country. Whether in Davos or other forums the prime minister does not fail to articulate his vision of development and prosperity and argues that the country has all requisite infrastructures and guarantees for investors to put in their capital and technology.

However, the aspiration to achieve prosperity and development does indeed rest on the capacity to generate and mobilise resources and utilide them efficiently and effectively. A casual appraisal reveals that the country's capacity to implement development projects is very poor characterised by low utilisation and miscarriage of the resources. This is clearly mentioned in the report presented by the Public Expenditure Review Commission (PERC) the other day. This has resulted into shortfall in achieving the developing target. This has also engendered low and shrunken outcomes in building infrastructures and physical assets critically needed for the development and prosperity of the country.

Several projects which are glorified as the projects of national pride are allowed to languish in tatters. Whether it is airport, road, hydropower or irrigation constructions, no projects have been completed in time. They incur exorbitant and escalated cost overruns. In order that our development projects are completed in time and make planning process more viable and result oriented, it is essential that our capacity to utilise resources is bolstered and project development and implementation governance is fully set right. Needless to say, in the least developed countries like Nepal, economic planning is the tool for development. Economic planning has been used in Nepal for the last several decades.

The philosophy of the economic planning can be broadly categorised into two types -- indicative planning and imperative planning. The Indicative planning is mostly used in the countries where free market economy has been adopted. The indicative planning sets the targeted rate of growth for the economy as a whole for a specific period of time. In this type of planning role of private sector, civil society, cooperatives and other development partners is considered to be important where state plays the role of a facilitator and enabler. On the other hand, imperative planning is a fully state administered and guided kind of planning. This kind of planning functions within the hierarchical framework of state machinery. This was more popular in the socialist countries like the dissolved Soviet Union introduced by communist leader Joseph Stalin and continued till the fall of communism in the dissolved Soviet Union. But modern China has made innovative adaptation and used this method of planning very successfully. But now this type of planning has been more or less abandoned. Nepal follows the mixed type of planning process where the role of the public, private, cooperative and civil sectors has been recognised and valued for development. However, it is generally agreed that a development planning process should start with perspective plan. The perspective plan embodies an assessment of the country's long term development outlook and broader goals. Then the perspective plan is followed by the periodic plan. The annual plans and projects implement the targets of the periodic plan. The total activities of the government should elaborate and reflect in the planning document.

Nepal has already implemented more than a dozen periodic development plans and projects. The review conducted by the government has shown that the most of the plans could not achieve their targets. The reason why plans for development fail in Nepal is typically diagnosed by the Swedish economist Gunar Myrdal who had earned reputation worldwide for reason of his famous work called The Asian Drama. He mentioned that poor technology, underdeveloped institutions for enterprise and development, imperfections in the authority of the government, centralised governance system, corruption, low efficiency and poor standards of integrity in public administration have been the major impediments affecting the implementation of development projects in Nepal.

With a view to address some of the issues and challenges pointed out above, Nepal embarked upon the moves towards instituting decentralised development planning process so that the local development projects are executed efficiently. However, the decentralised planning process has been totally disrespected. The overlapping and duplication of the federal, provincial and local level projects as indicated in the PERC report speaks volume of the centralised mindset in the planning process. The big sorts in the decision making level and powerful politicians control and sideline the defined statutory planning process and plan their own pet projects to support their respective constituencies.

Prime Minister Oli and leaders like Prachanda are not an exception to it. As mentioned above, planning process has been rendered completely dysfunctional in Nepal. It is not only centralised but also personalised. The political leaders, bureaucrats and those who can dictate and manipulate the official channels can make the planning wheel move as a consequence of which projects are misallocated and resources are misused in larger proportion.

In theory, Nepal has adopted the bottom up planning process sanctioned and validated by the federal constitution. But the whole process has been turned into mockery allowing the crafty politicians and rapacious bureaucrats to meddle fully in the planning mechanism and system. Unless the whole planning system is revamped, reoriented and project governance system reformed in the true spirit of federalism, Nepal's development trajectory is not likely to take off and move upward.

### The Participatory Governance

Nepal has come along an important and far-reaching process of political development and transformation over the last few years. It has undergone change from a centralised unitary state structures to federal democratic republic to redeem pledge to deliver justice, prosperity and welfare to citizens. The Constitution enacted by the popularly elected Constituent Assembly in 2015 has restructured Nepal into three tiers of government - federal, province and local. And these governments have been assigned with important functional competencies and mandates.

Roles

In the federal architecture of functional assignment, the local governments - rural and urban municipalities - are entrusted with important roles and functions that are mainly related with local policy making, development planning and implementation, school education and health service delivery and local dispute resolution and management. The Local Government Operation Act, 2017 elaborates the functional responsibilities of the local government that range from governing, regulating to management of local development planning and service delivery functions at the local level. At the core of these functional allocations among the three-tier of the government lies the imperatives of the representation and participation of citizens in the government decision making process. This aspect is very much spelt out in the preamble, directive principles of state policy, fundamental rights chapter of the constitution, acts and guidelines issued by the government time and again.

Moreover, the Local Government Operation Act 2017 intends to promote collaborative governance through citizen participation at the local level while the Good Governance Guidelines 2018 issued for enhancing transparency practices at local government posits citizens and CSOs as the key actors to engage with local governments to strengthen social accountability process and practices.

Needless to repeat, citizen participation is indeed a key ingredient in the recipe for democratisation and development. It contributes to increase transparency and ownership of citizens in decision making process. If citizens are involved in the policy development, they will be able to make government officials more accountable and responsive for their actions and decisions. In fact, local and participatory democracy can be institutionalised properly only when a constructive collaboration and engagement between local government institutions and citizens is duly facilitated, fostered and strengthened. It is also the duty of citizen to participate in decision making process at local level because, in one way or another, he or she will be influenced by the policies implemented by the government.

Moreover, citizen participation should not be undertaken under any special circumstances, but should be a part of the everyday life of citizens. It is not a seasonal or occasional event. It is each citizen's right and responsibility to participate not only during the election period but also in times between elections. Citizens need time to learn about an issue and also know how they can influence the decision making process. The government should inform the citizens about policy development as well as their roles. Media plays an important role in citizen participation. Information can be disseminated to the population at large in a very easy and efficient matter through use of the media. Citizen participation in local government decision making process not only enhances legitimacy of local government but also promotes and institutionalises practices on accountability and transparency.

It is also realistic and less transactional for citizens to oversee and monitor the governing and local development planning and implementation practices at the local level. This can help ensure that local resources are properly utilised consistent to local needs and preferences. In addition to it, citizen stakeholders can participate and feed their inputs into local policy formulation which can ensure local authorship and ownership of local laws and bylaws. Though enabling policy and legal framework exist for citizen participation at the local level as enshrined in the constitution of Nepal, and local government law, the proposed national integrity policy and directives issued by the Home Ministry to rein in on the activities of the INGOs and NGOs have, however, given rise to concerns and apprehensions on the intent of the new government in dealing with civil society. Moreover, concerns have been raised in the media regarding the partisan orientation of the civil society from local to the national level that has allegedly diminished their independent role and objectivity.

Moreover, restructuring of local government, carried out prior to local elections in accordance with the recommendations of the Local Level Restructuring Commission (LLRC) held in 2016, has slashed the number of municipalities from around 3,500 to 753 which has increased size of the local governments both in terms of territory and demography. It has also impacted the political density with significant variation in population – representative ratio. Moreover, the local government offices have gone removed from the walking distance of local communities presenting difficulties in contacting the representatives and officials apart from accessing services.

Collaboration

Since the local level elections held last for the rural municipalities (Gaupalikas) and Municipalities (Nagarpalikas), the elected representatives have formulated policies, plans, programmes and projects for the last fiscal year and this year in succession. It is generally found that the local projects are selected and formulated without consultation with the local citizens which can be labelled as pork barrel projects. The projects are generally found being allocated based on the partisan consideration not on the basis of the local needs. Moreover, local tax rates and service fees/tariffs have been revised allegedly without consultation with local community and concerned stakeholders. It is time multi-tiered governments especially the local government should interact with citizens on every issue that impact them in their day to day life. This can give a sense of ownership and motivate citizens to cooperate and collaborate with the activities of the government institutions.

### Digitalizing future

In India, the use of the digital biometric identity code was initially optional - and served poor people to claim benefits. The Supreme Court confirmed that the use of the ID system should be voluntary. Nonetheless, it is required for ever more purposes. Civil-society activists warn of privacy breaches and improper surveillance. This is an example of how, in the course of the past ten years, developmental visions related to digitalisation have been getting darker.

From the mid-90s to the Arab spring of 2011, a sense of euphoria was common. Before the 1990s, however, information technology simply did not seem to be relevant for developing countries.

That began to change, when international media became aware of the IT hub that had evolved around Bangalore. Next, internet access spread fast, and, though digital divides persisted, the World Wide Web came ever closer to living up to its name. Then mobile telephony conquered much of Africa. Suddenly, Kenya was pioneering mobile money. Digital technology was making a difference in evermore people's lives, and masses of them were poor.

Mobile phones became commonly used devices even in remote villages. People got access to more information than ever before and started to interact with others who are far away. In many ways, digitalisation was empowering. For example, social media proved essential in the Arab spring. As dictators fell, journalists spoke of "Facebook revolutions". That was then. Platforms that seemed to facilitate free communication 10 years ago, are now infested with disinformation and propaganda. The business models of established media houses are being undermined, to the detriment of quality journalism. Instead of living in "knowledge societies" as we were promised, we seem to understand less and less.

As a general trend, both public administrations and private-sector businesses are computerised. Digital disruption is common, and leaders in both spheres are paying increasingly close attention to what is discussed online, with some doing their best to manipulate public discourse. Authoritarian populism is gaining ground, while the respect for democracy seems to be waning in many places. China's communist regime is leading the trend of monitoring citizens, but other governments seem eager to follow.

At the same time, the corporate powers that dominate the internet today are still largely beyond government control. They are not paying taxes commensurate with their revenues. The top managers cultivate a liberal image, but their lobbyists are really only striving to protect the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple from regulation. The algorithms of Facebook and YouTube, which belong to the Google parent company Alphabet, are driving the radicalisation of angry people by offering users ever more extreme content to keep them on the platforms.

Digitalisation is shaping our species' future. We need sensible rules. The forces that dominate the web are far more powerful than most nation states. The only three political entities that still seem able to regulate them are the USA, China and the EU. At this point, only the EU shows a preference for protecting citizens' rights. If other countries want to have an impact, they must forge alliances. That way they can tap technology's still promising potentials and keep a check on the risks. There is no alternative if we do not want to surrender to overwhelming corporate or state power.

### Note on constitutionalism

Constitutionalism refers to the rules of fair governance. As a vital element of democratic order, it lays the design of a polity central to power distribution, its ties with the state's institutions and citizens and code of conduct to coordinate a variety of goals in many realms. Aiming to place rule of law, it sets the normative standards of society to balance between freedom and authority, politics and law and rights and duties of citizens and the state. Constitutionalism averts the tyranny of majority by the wheels of public reason. It limits the rulers' authority by placing checks on power and creating autonomous legal safeguards to protect minority. It deters the confiscatory sort of distributive struggle of minority and social movements and forestalls both democratic decline and relapse into despotism. Democratic constitution aids the poor by social policies, taxing the wealthy and devolving resources so that they abide by the rules of game. Embodying political realism, constitutionalism sets a process of gaining, using and transferring power and subjecting vital matters to judicial review. Adjudication means nothing if court's verdicts are prejudiced screwed or non-carried out. It splits law from the integrity of ethical life.

Burden
The ritual of extra-constitutional path of regime change in Nepal has, however, imposed a huge burden on political stability and national affinity of citizens. It has muddled the constitutional which may be lucrative for a slew of legal elites who know how to exploit the flaws of human nature and devour the weak by due process of law. Awareness about injustice can easily recharge the battery of estranged groups to spiral their struggle against the natural selection of life to a higher plane of global consciousness and draw international jurisdiction to act. Nepal's constitutional practice has, however, saw the primacy of power equation over norms, values and cultural wisdom cutting the unity of political life with the state. Conformity with constitutionalism can make Nepal better governed. But it will not make Nepalis happier unless quality of life improves.

Trapped in web of power than the reason of constitutionalism, Nepali leaders failed to tend law-based conduct of citizens prompting the alienated to indulge in stir and ease the collapse of one Constitution after another. The Constitution of Nepal 2015 has experienced a thorny delivery though it added more rights to citizens and was endorsed by a vast number of legislators. It faced a strong resistance from Madhesi parties while India had tied itself with the UK and the EU to oppose it for not being amply "inclusive." It unveiled that Nepal's post-conflict order has substituted one type of conflict by the other finding the constitution no immune from geopolitical infection. The discrepancy in normal politics and huge promises in the constitution and incoherence of its various parts and unlawful behavior of elites have burdened it with infinite tasks beyond the capacity of the state to carry. As a result, political game is pivoted on who should control power, not settle peace, justice and progress. Evolved as a compromise text of fractious political parties-NC, Maoist-Center and CPN-UML- the constitution faces a clash between norms and facts. The spars of radical left, social movements, armed actors and right wing, blinded by their politics, can be harder to extirpate if leaders defer demands and amend the constitution without caring its effects. Without all actors ensuring a stake in the polity, the constitution will continue to face extra-constitutional challenges.

Nepali constitution embodies scores of democratic values for the creation of an egalitarian society. But it failed to pull away from the pack of multi-caste, ethnicity, gender, religion, class or territoriality to catch its own legacy of enlightenment. As a power map for shared rule, constitutionalism reflects the national goals and course. Discursive production of law is enduring. It allows the inclusion of interests and values of all sides. Nepal's constitutionalism is, however, facing a tension between those seeking to amend the Constitution and those finding no rationale for it, bargaining for interests and sharing values, and constitutional spirit of socialist-oriented economy and the reality of corporatism. A major shift has occurred in Nepal as law is finding resonance in popular sovereignty, albeit the tensions between economic dependence and independence, secularism and multi-religious society and equality of citizenship and reference to multiple castes and races. Democratisation process propelled by citizen equality is hamstrung by a politics of difference. So long as civic engagement revolves around personalised leadership, the separation between the public and the private sphere remains blurred and issues are settled less on the basis of constitutionality than the fallacy of legal logic. In such a context, constitution fails to become a safety valve and arbitrator of rival forces signifying a shared common good. Nepal's constitutional peril is that proportional representation will always create a patchy legislature given its plural electorate and executive will chronically suffer from a game of musical chair. Acculturation of leaders into its ideals can reshape democratic thinking and habits. The civic roots of its culture are conducive to constitutionalism as they prized justice at multi-sphere to maximise citizens' happiness.

The declaration of secular, federal democratic republic, social inclusion, proportional representation and gender justice helped Nepalis to redefine their social ties contesting what is undemocratic in its political culture. Democracy, as a bottom up process, presumes the self-liberation of citizens. Elected bodies are its laboratory. Engaged citizens see the prospect for: social representation, the the rise of network politics, contestation of the boundaries of majoritarian democracy, and the universalisation of human rights through the legitimacy of international obligations and constraints. Their constitutional awareness is vital to fortify engaging culture, make leadership accountable to social contract and nurture a culture of compromise between the politics of opposites and control wild appetite for arbitrary action, cronyism, impunity and corruption hostile to criminal justice system. If Nepal's macro institutions uphold national integrity and constitutionalise societal institutions they can defy entropy and make constitutionalism a self-binding ideal. But if the leaders and legal fraternity feed each other they can subvert its virtue. The challenge in Nepal is how to foster legal culture driven by public reason.
Constitutionalism entails reforming bleak economic basics and giving Nepalis a choice in the life's process, not only the unequal exchange of its labour for capital whose social costs stay howling. Given Nepali parties' manifold inclinations leadership consensus at the top remains fragile to address power dynamics and moral atrophy which bend the values of constitutionalism. Business penetration of politics and political penetration of bureaucracy mar its spirit to balance the interest of class and the mass in policy matters. Nepal is suitable for a culture of constitutionalism but undue passion of mini-identities requires optimisation. Its roots of civility provided Nepalis to stay together and build collective cultural memory conducive to a stable national identity. Cultural factors and social diversity are two key elements for democratic checks and national resilience. But Nepal needs to overcome two critical democratic deficits: substantive one in the grasp of all Constitutional rights and equalisation of welfare across diverse groups through evidence-based policy; and procedural one in terms of proportionality of social representation in power to erase the legitimacy and efficiency gaps. This can discourage politics of distributional coalitions seeking to negotiate the weak Nepali state for sectoral benefits and check the modernity's hedonistic treadmill infecting Nepali constitutionalism and leaving its citizens restless than before.
Two ironies pervade Nepal's constitution: promise of social welfare state and funding crunch to realise it leaving its politics aspirational and right to self-rule inherent in popular sovereignty which bars the impunity of interest groups but inability to govern local bodies as they face legal, administrative, infrastructure and resources bottlenecks. Partisan legal culture has become an enemy of reason where even a close circle of legal fraternity detests each other's views and defends its side despite its demerit. It has stymied Nepali state's ability to execute the constitution even with huge electoral legitimacy. Democracy within the state sets an open-access order for its citizens while beyond the state entails "institutional closure" and constitutional outreach to international regimes and laws. Lack of coherence between the state, economy and citizenship, beyond the state forces is flagging state-centric constitutionalism.

Tradition
Political stability in Nepal requires the lawful tradition of politics and attainment of autonomy, reliability and adaptability of public institutions in service delivery. Inequality of resource affects the quality of democracy and deprives one-third Nepalis at the bottom having no control over their destiny. They need resources, skills and opportunity. Democracy is the project of modernity. It abhors both pre-modern politics of tribalism and post-modern lack of affection to national affinity. As a compromise formula, it stresses on building the national identity of citizens. Nepal's constitutional history suggests that discontinuity of politics marked the failure of political classes to achieve their political tasks and create more winners of democratic game. A win-win outcome can create the stake of rural poor and minorities, women and Dalits and their ownership in its process and ignite a fresh faith in constitutional governance.

### Democratic citizenship

Democratic citizenship is a central issue of political theory and practice. Good training in citizenship rights and duties enables them to exercise valid judgment on public issues, assume social responsibilities and voluntarily participate in public affairs. Democratic citizenship is based on the values of enlightenment: reason, freedom, equality, solidarity and courage integrated to each other in a sparkling awareness about self and feeling right inside without being biased to others. It helps overcome customary and institutional fetters. Rousseau is right in putting feelings of the heart above the reasons of mind for a democratic political culture. It liberates citizens from the perils of determinism of fatalism, suffering, unfairness, domination and perpetual infantalisation of democracy, sishu loktantra. Nepali citizens, therefore, require full awareness of democratic politics, institutions and constitution to lead a life of choice, participation and dignity.

An irony pervades Nepal's political discourse. Nepalis face disharmonies between the compelling constitutional vision and sordid practice and their shared existence and lack of enough public goods for many those left behind. So long as the antinomy of freedom and injustice remains, it does not cultivate citizenship virtues or consistency of shared insights with the global community. Hans J. Morgenthau narrates three dimensions of human life--biological, rational and spiritual. Individuals move from one scale of desire, will and passion to the next based on the plane of their education and vigilance from childhood, adulthood and old age till death as a final point fossilises them.

Mere biological life espouses the survival of the fittest. The spring of self-justifying rational dimension is hotly contested now for its inability to solve all human problems. The higher scale one moves among the spiritual and moral dimensions, the greater the role of eternal wisdom and inclusiveness where what Astavakra calls "one sees others like oneself." The spirit of modern age of citizenship arises from the feeling of affection, attachment, mutual respect and support to each other for a satisfying role in the polity.

Education for democratic citizenship in Nepal is vital for the cultivation of democratic manner, integrity, attitude and habits. It brings democratic values to the life of each individual, family, school, political parties and public institutions and unshackles Nepalis from the aristocracy of organised power of leaders and their own audacity to frequently defy it in each election demanding reforms. A balance between will and wisdom is vital for the triumph of justice in the order of community, society, polity, the state and international relations. For this, Nepalis must acquire civic virtues and temperament beyond their social conditioning and allegiance to their families, castes, classes, peer groups, educational intuitions, professions and political parties to a duty to the Nepali state, goodwill to humanity and caring of other species upon whom they live on.

The role of Nepali media, Election Commission, civil society, educational institutions and political parties lies in training adults for democratic citizenship who do not escape the judgment of others in the life-enhancing activities and sustain thought-control or detached thinking from the web of life. The later trend does not make Nepalis future conscious and politicised which is a characteristic of democratic citizenship.

Nepal's classical treatises find relative importance of three virtues in human beings tamo, rajo and satto guna strutting three paths of life- bhakti (service or devolution) karma (action deciding the destiny) and gyan (enlightenment). It is absurd to think of good leaders without worthy citizens able to internalise these cognitive and affective virtues and expand the public sphere. Dialogical, reflective and contextual method of learning about the condition of life and discovering true knowledge and work for the resolution of problems in Nepal have positive effects than self-deceiving rote learning.

Ancient Nepal followed justice as a basis of rule. It transcends the disciplinary cage to include ecological, social, gender and intergenerational spheres. It also cites a cosmological understanding of self and others. The tradition of collective leadership in Nepali parties, however, often faces a cacophony, tension and cracks as fractious leaders innocent of culture have failed to appeal across fractional divides and govern the group affinity through collective competence. Unaware of their sovereignty, Nepalis also desire to get support from their leaders like children from their parents. It may look selfish to outsiders but it has deep roots in Asian culture which makes difficult for leaders to acquire public spirit that can transcend both individual and inner-circle of group interests and serve general public goods. A high sense of civic competence of Nepalis is, therefore, essential to build confidence in shaping the content, course and action of democratic citizenship.

Now the decay of ideologies has surged postmodern identity politics. But it has also opened pre-political tendencies and commercial interests to flourish. This socially constructed identity of late capitalism cuts the chance for democratic citizenship of equality. What would Nepal's future look like when language, culture and religion that fabricated its national identity are laid to rest, hotly contested or disfigured? Individual identity is defined by the self and also by others. The modern Nepali state gave them an identity of citizenship which is stable and universal. In Nepal, citizenship is required for voting, land and property purchase, job opportunity and entitlement to constitutional rights. It provides citizenship on the basis of ancestry, birth certificate, residence, marriage, etc. and intends to issue identity cards for every native by putting them into a digital system. It is important for them to pay tax, improve life condition, protect public property and extend loyalty and support when the state needs. The consolidation of democratic citizenship in Nepal is a vanguard against feudalism, tribalism and fundamentalism of all sorts as it fosters civic patriotism.

The ability of Nepali state to constitutionalise all actors of society is a must for sustainable democracy. Democracy cannot be equated with inter and intra-party politicking, divisive debate on national issues, polity, power and authority, squabbles of civil servants and unrestrictive, noisy politics for the change of regime every time or subversion of electoral mandate to fulfil personal ambition. They kill altruistic thirst and defy political stability and democratic culture based on self-determination of Nepalis. Civic virtue upholds public spiritedness, balance in giving and taking and civic engagement from public decency, respect to elders, cleaning of roads, planting trees, controlling domestic violence to defending national interests.

The identification of the character traits that constitute civic virtue has been a key concern of civic culture fit for Nepali democracy. Civility refers to cognition, attitude and behaviour Nepali leaders and citizens conform to Constitution, trust of authority and the sanity of the nation's tradition but also keen to execute international obligations. Spiritual faith does not make Nepalis feeble nor does secular anthropocentrism make them great by causing the leaders' personalised authority rot thus cultivating an institutional culture.

Civic disposition helps to guide on making good citizen. Its fundamental universal traits necessary for Nepal are: First, building civic confidence of Nepalis to be able to engage in civic life of multi-level governance as free and enduring genius. It enriches the robustness of democracy while lack of it creates public apathy, alienation or negation incubating parochial political culture. Second, civic disposition is the product of educational praxis where Nepalis understand their duties associated with self and the public institutions which enable them to live together under the same sovereignty linking knowledge to serve the life world.

Third, as a post-conflict state Nepalis must be educated to know non-violent ways of communication, decent ways to be open, tolerant and responsible in cooperative action to perfect a sense of humility. Civic disposition of democratic citizenship does not mean a culture of conformism and silence; they are social cancers but active engagement in the solution of society's problems. Fourth, traits of civic disposition in Nepal involve the virtues of active citizenship that combine the qualities of civic mindedness, commitment, responsibility, critical thinking, courage, patriotism, openness, compromising on reasonable issues, compassion to the weak, honest, respect for rule of law and deference for other's rights and dignity. Compliance to these attributes makes a general ferment of hope for democratic citizenship in Nepal which also makes a difference in the nation's life.

### Leadership Imperatives

Modern time is dotted by a moment of great transformation. Multiple crises in the world are threatening the rule-based order. Leaders, as societal catalysts, are struggling to cope with them through workable policies. The acceleration of scientific revolution-innovation, information, communication and technology is causing big disruption buffeting every aspect- nature, institutions, laws and rituals of normal life. In this wind of change only the transformational leaders, with creative imagination, understanding and experience about scientific progress, can cope with them by a specialised team of experts, reap from its benefits and free the vigorous productive forces alive in society. Their intellectual ability lies in crafting a shared vision to navigate the future, coordinate change and organise collective action.

Transformational leaders do not have the illusion of human nature. They differ from normal transactional politicians who, locked in the pyramid of status consciousness, seek only nauseating conformity and loyalty of followers through both rewards and punishments and resort to vote-buying and rent-seeking strategy as a survival imperative. In a nation like Nepal with diversity, leaders, with enlightenment beliefs and entrepreneurial zeal, can inspire citizens to constitutional goals, broaden their perspectives for national unity and animate their motivation, morale and performance.

Leadership training for greatness enables them to sail with the flow of change and prosper together with citizens, their culture and the state and become pro-active in untangling complicated problems. There are philosophers behind the success of great leaders. Sage Astavakra trained king Janak on atma gyan (inner vigilance) helping him to acquire divine quality of higher moral purpose and timeless worldly wisdom in rule. Inward training for the cultivation of good character is beneficial to self and others in need.

During Mahabharat times, Bidur invented many policy measures for the leaders to follow. Neglect of his advice triggered the War of Mahavarata. Plato envisaged the importance of a philosopher king for just governance and advised the ruler of Syracuse. His disciple Aristotle trained Alexander the Great. In India, Kautilya schooled Chandra Gupta who ruled the Indian empire while Niccolo Machiavelli tutored prince Medici of Italy. In China, Mencius was advisor of King Qi.

These leaders were men of vision, integrity and consequence. They did not divinise leaders' personality but humanised their behaviour towards citizens. The ideal traits of leadership rest more on connecting themselves with citizens in a common public purpose than dividing, dominating or controlling them like in feudal era. Now, the reinvention of ancient art and wisdom has become relevant in Nepal for the cultivation of leadership so that they focus on vision, connectivity and ability to collaborate with citizens in weal and woe.

In a new democracy like Nepal leaders' imperatives to rule increase in proportion to the position they occupy in the institutions aiming to fulfil citizens' expectations for the happiness of a rational life. Leadership virtues that keep the vitality of charisma are vital to connect citizens in a fractured world, solve their problems, enable to move beyond their personality and frame a positive shadow of the future. But the charisma is transient. It needs to be replaced soon by legal-rational authority legitimised by elections, process and performance.

This is why every country sets up think tanks to provide synthetic inputs to national leaders and build their capacity for awareness, adaptation and responsiveness to any change or challenge plaguing the nation. The decline of ideological leadership in Nepal marked the rise of professional, careerist politician of bureaucratic type which led a sharp break with the solidaristic politics and entered into networking driven by passion, instinct and self-promotion without any interest in remedying challenges of national unity, stability and peace. The conversion of Nepali leaders into a catch-all type with a strong bent on expediency, not consistency with their policies, posed a drag in improving the lot of citizens.

Nepali leaders have displayed enough courage to stir the emotion of citizens and offered them programmes for a better democratic world with freedom, justice and peace. Their leadership style and rhetoric inspired Nepalis of all walks of life to synchronise their political action for regime change. But they have shown poor quality in the governance as they reflect the partisan view of their political brand and feel no need to change the political culture they are socialised into performing. Leadership in Nepali language means netritwo, the upholders of right public policies.

Ironically, Nepali leaders have abdicated the policy making duty and applied borrowed policies from abroad without indigenising them to fit the peculiarities of national situation. Its outcome is polarised development. Their vigilance about the changing context, values, issues and institutions are critical indicators for their success in mobilising resources to satisfy Nepalis' expectations of democratic dividends. The sputtering success of Communist Party of Nepal in multi-level elections and promise of political stability, prosperity and happiness provided the nation a chance for a stable rule. But the political will for this is bitten by intra-party leadership feud and multi-hued social ferments straining the morale of public institutions to do something better.

The top leaders of opposition, Nepali Congress, alienated from each other and forlorn hope of citizens, have just completed their national awakening programmes seeking to consolidate the party by abolishing internal sabotage and leadership feud, holding timely elections of auxiliary bodies, linking with the grassroots and providing leadership opportunity for youth. The Madhesi parties, Rastriya Prajatantra Party and smaller left parties are engaged in fissiparous tendencies- unity-split-unity- while all left forces have a common strategy of unity-struggle-transformation through democratic centralism.

In Nepal, transformation has largely been delayed because of the split of critical masses, delay in translating the mandate, declining standards of education, economy, organisation and interdependence among social forces and overlap the old and new elements. The growth of enlightened leaders in the institutions of society is faster in networks and movements than the government and political parties to respond who end up performing by rote, not institutional memory.

The cascade of vices has shaken the poise of bulk of youth in politics. Some are fighting for inner party democracy, others are engaged in self-chosen civil society, federations, foundations and social movements to gain greater social legitimacy for self-governance and still others are forced to migrate abroad in search of job, brain drain or stay disaffected. The use of demographic dividends only to accumulate remittance and suppression of market competition by economic maladies have bred kleptocratic networks with impunity which cut the regulative power of the state to constitutionalise society and perform basic functions.

Democracy has opened the Nepali society to the new values and elevated citizens to a source of sovereignty where leaders can learn from their experience and become thoughtful, virtuous and reflective. Popular sovereignty helps leaders to break the usual way of seeing the world in a linear way advanced by social sciences but engage in it from all sides and know, like statesperson, the logic of transformation at all the spheres- family, community, society, political parties and state institutions. Nepal has seen a cycle of regime change without the chance to consolidate polity. The first reason is weak leadership with cultic personality. It only lulled their supporters into believing the utopia, even in a time of uncertainty and turning crisis of political order acute. Nepali leaders are less socialised in native knowledge, geography, history and culture and the zeitgeist vital for the transformation of feudal, patronage-based and clientalistic culture into civic one. This has led to the rise of strongman politics, father figure or leader-for-life, a sort of creeping authoritarianism.

The second reason is that political power is tottered by hereditary, family-friendly, patronage-based and coterie politics delinked from the reflection on history, public opinion and meritocratic virtues. As a result, the trust of citizens and party cadres on the leadership is shifting from one to another. The third reason is the operating style of Nepali parties in a personalised way without broad-based consultative practices with local party leaders, cadres and citizens. The fourth reason is politics is dominated by money where each values the other on the basis of monetary clout than the ideals of democratic life.

The capacity of Nepali leaders is beset by powerful interest groups screwing positive effects of public policies. Unlike in China where business and politics are separate spheres, Nepali leaders and businessmen are wearing both crowns strong enough to rip the social contract where citizens pay the taxes in return for security and redistribution of resources. This has inverted a balance of power between the state and the market. Transformation endures when the sanity of civic power guides the establishment and critical mass of change either acculturate citizens or assume leadership to set new state-society balance where out-dated structures, norms and practices are replaced by the new democratic rules and constraints, not stuffed by personal loyalists of leaders in all public institutions who skew the impersonal distribution of public goods.

In this context, Nepali leaders have to coordinate between the public servants and the public under a common authority, mediate between the top decision-making centre and the bottom of society for the articulation of citizens' needs and priorities based on a common conception of justice, mindfulness to ecological, social, gender and intergenerational concerns to help each citizen gain means of purpose in life, minimisation of their personal ambition for the promotion of public goods and break the passivity of citizens through civic education instilling in them problem-solving capacity to the challenges of democratisation and acquire collaborative learning to adapt to transformation underway.

### Virtues of Participatory Democracy

Participatory democracy is rooted in the active engagement of citizens in the public interest associations to attain self-governing goal, improve the condition of life and resolve common problems in the framework of social justice. Its defining values are popular sovereignty, right-based culture, power devolution, justice, human rights and an admission of citizens to the realm of public life. These values create popular space for citizens to build choice, organisation, leadership, knowledge and solidarity beyond the classical frame of party politics. The right to participate is altering the nature of class-based party politics of industrial era socialised by mass media to multi-channel communication and representation of citizens' diverse interests in political power to shape public agenda.

Citizens' conscious participation, based on their own experience and capacity for self-reflection on their living condition, itself is the source of learning about freedom, legitimacy, authority, ownership and mitigation of the problem of collective choice. Participation in multi-functional spheres maximises their power, secures essential needs, rights and legitimate aspirations and enables them to control the effects of their action. The linking of economy to ecological and social policies helps to overcome the pitfalls of representative democracy where rule and domination become prerogative of majority party exercised from top down and less caring for common good of those at the bottom. It has fed grievance, political instability and conflict infecting good life.

Participatory democracy marks citizens' voluntary and innovative zeal in politics and public affairs and its favorable outcome for a just political order. It has built their confidence in cutting the distance between constitutional vision and uneven conditions and preventing the return of demosclerosis. Joshua Cohen speaks to ensure "participation rights" in constitutional dispensation to "guarantee a fair value of these rights" and "produce legislation that encourages a fair distribution according to the difference principle."

The crisis of representative democracy is caused by its inability to fit economy's race to become global. There are other factors: the decay of industrial civilization with the onset of information revolution and its class based format of politics based on capital and labor, friend and foe and their free collective bargaining; surge of new issues such as climate change, interdependence, globalization, technological acceleration, migration etc entailing beyond state-centric basis of cooperation; birth of multi-classes of electorates with the participation of previously marginalized groups such as women, poor, labor and minorities struggling for recognition and renegotiation of a new social contract; decline of efficacy of ideological representation of social classes of multi-cultural society; rise of anti-party, anti-institutional social struggles and global associational revolution enabling Nepalis to reclaim decision making power to determine their destiny. It has offered opportunity for their participation in areas affecting their life, liberty and choice and halt a race to the bottom. The ideological crisis of representative democracy has created a transformative moment for participatory democracy driven by pluralistic politics, knowledge and information revolution. Integration of women, Dalits, Janajatis, Aadibasis, Madhesis, labor, minorities, human rights, ecologists and peace advocates in the representation of knowledge, policy, power and resource sharing has created a new constitutional basis for level playing field for organized groups. Nepali constitution ensures 33 percent representation of women in national and sub-national parliaments and 40 percent in local bodies.

Participatory democracy has enlarged the rights of citizens including self-determination in politics, ecology, culture, social and economic spheres seeking to prevent outside bullying and address the concerns of diverse society. It marked a qualitative shift of citizenship from "original position" of inequality to equal constitutional entitlements of inclusive citizenship and proportional representation. It is shifting the power of citizens previously governed by what John Rawls calls "the veil of ignorance" to entitlement-based enlightenment now. In Nepal, this is supported by inclusive procedures in civic, political and state institutions, change of electoral system, shared and self-rule with legislative, executive, judicial and financial power, social welfare, formation of inclusive commissions for many groups of citizens, etc despite their unequal virtues, intelligence and abilities.

Another shift lies in collective bargaining of interest between the capital and the labor to a spirit of cooperation of the government, private business and social enterprises of Nepali society to support public goals common in pluralistic politics though the distribution of its profits is skewed. Still, another shift is in the culture of bureaucracy from administration to communication, coordination and delivery of public goods and services to Nepalis to make multi-level governance functional. Participatory democracy says David Held "fosters human development, enhances a sense of political efficacy, reduces a sense of estrangement from power centers, nurtures a concern for collective problems and contributes to the formation of an active and knowledgeable citizenry capable of taking a more acute interest in governmental affairs." Active citizens equipped with a sense of duties do not escape from social responsibilities but creatively participate in public affairs, the market, political parties, civil society, the state and global public sphere seeking fulfilling life. The praxis of participatory democracy evolves where citizens enrich their cognitive resources and experience, apply their practical knowledge and exercise their reason in problem solution through public action as per Local Government Operation Act.

Political emancipation of citizens generates civic competence and innovative social capital while human emancipation enables to acquire humanity based on the protection and promotion of human rights as an intrinsic value of participatory democracy. Information revolution has pluralised the governing powers, civic association and activism and entailed the involvement of affected citizens in decision making turning it transparent and accountable. An awareness about mutual vulnerability of singular institutional life is vital for the birth of solidarity of larger public to participate in collective action. The social struggles of non-class Guthis, journalists, human rights, conflict-victims, educational and health institutions, sub-national units, recently freed bonded labor and civil society demanding stakeholders' consultation in law making beyond the partisan bias of parliament reflect the assertion of popular sovereignty assuming moral, democratic and cultural dimensions of politics and a revolt against Nepali legislature for alienating self from policy production, confinement to public resources through patronage networks and treating Nepalis as an object of development intervention.

The right to shape consultative outcome can flatten vertical integration of party structures giving cadres a sense of freedom, equality and autonomy. Nepali leaders can directly communicate and receive feedback from their voters now. Those not in the loops are facing social, gender and intergenerational tensions in the party committees. The ideological solidarity has shifted to value and issues-based networks and bottom up collective action. Democratization of the inner life of Nepali political parties can break the vices of clientalism, paternalism, factionalism and leadership cult bolstering the base of participatory democracy where experiences of citizens enables in transforming their condition.

Nepali citizens have cognitive ability and skill derived from contextual learning, will and opinion forming institutions about participation in political agitation, hunger strike, protests, demonstration, electoral campaigns, social movements and community engagements. They are vital to improve participatory quality and exert democratic control on decision expecting to spur higher scale of freedom, equity and justice. The political efficacy of Nepalis' engagement in many self-chosen, self-managed and solidaristic organizations such as consumer committee, ward assembly, community governance, civil society, NGOs, cooperatives, school, community forestry, irrigation and local bodies' federations etc is self-evident. They acquire experience and resources to influence policies. Local laws oblige citizens, elected leaders and government officials codetermine planning, manage resources, build infrastructures, execute and monitor various scales of projects. Local leaders and civil servants alone cannot self-determine vital matters without public hearing. Still, in a number of cases where civic competence of citizens is low cooptation of influential persons provide them a semblance of ownership in the initiatives and civic action. In other cases, citizens become mere implementers of decisions which mark the continuity of paternalistic, bureaucratic and hierarchic working style antithetical to participatory democracy.

Increased voters' participation in Nepali elections to above 70 per cent is sufficient to legitimise the polity. Those not voting were either abroad, harbored political apathy or lacked civic virtues. Invalid voting turnout of about 3 percent can be attributed to a lack of voters' education on the election system. It is doubtful whether the Nepali voters have full knowledge of the issues, leadership and organisations debated by the media or attend local meetings with leaders vital foWr evolving participant culture. Their final decision to cast ballot is determined more by social characteristics and leader affiliation than rational calculation to hone the virtues of institutional life of democracy. Rational participation requires a strong doze of civic enlightenment in Nepal. It helps to address the rationality of governance performance and nurture the virtues of participatory democracy.

### Civic Role in Development

Nepali society is in a steady process of change. The wind of change impelled by science is altering its social structures and rules of civic engagement. Nepal's Constitution has rewarded an enabling milieu for citizens to engage in development. But the vitality for this needs knowledge, vision, desire and will for mutual aid. Institutional explosion in the nation has offered a non-party option of associational solidarity. It emerged as a revulsion against the burden of swollen political classes and their penchant for patronage. The guiding aim for citizens is to realise constitutional goal of an egalitarian society through distributive justice and detribalisation of social life.
Nepalis across the diverse social and economic strata engage in collective action in matters of public good facilitated by their solidarity. Other approach to engagement is induced from above or catalysed by civic bodies from grassroots as per value change. Human rights recognise personhood of each Nepali beyond the rationality of collective greed. Social and cultural forces exert influence for a new national construction on the basis of their expanded rights and welfare state which can build civic capacity for poverty alleviation, reduce income difference, spur public ventures and nurture full citizenship. Diasporas go beyond national relativism of Nepaliness to widen development view and ignore the roots of native wisdom. In a democracy, self-awakening and action raise adaptive learning to change and reduce the cost of development. Rule-based civic stirrings across the party lines now stand for a common life of citizenship.

The seething cauldron of discontent of revolutionaries is subversive disposed to deconstruct the construction of state-citizens ties for a new way of life. Many constructions of activism in Nepal through the justification of contending development theories and ideologies are unsettling to autonomous development and civic culture built on bonding and bridging trust, common experience and mutual respect. Still, its syncretic culture offers social capital central to share the cost of development. Nepal has notably improved its education, communication, health, banking, market expansion, urbanisation and migration but remains slow in energy, production, trade and social progress vital to graduate to developing nation by 2022 and attain the SDGs.

Anticipation of a robust spell of high and inclusive economic growth needs a firm political course, massive scale of cooperation of private sector and international community and conversion of needs, interest and opinion of ordinary Nepalis into public policy. Mobilisation of local economic and human resources, diversified revenue and tax base to support the levelling up of the poor through distributive justice and voluntary public action against the raid over local common can propel self-directed prosperity, the leitmotif of development.

The Constitution provides the local bodies powers of self-governing polity and its vital elements- inclusiveness, transparency and accountability, if not responsiveness, to ensure good life. Still, the centre defines the rules, maintains vertical control over the provinces and local authorities on legal, financial and technical aspects and holds critical leverage despite peddling autonomy. In a diverse society only by up-scaling civic engagement can cut costs of progress. The right-based discourse in Nepal is politicising them and increasing their engagement in a myriad of institutions and activities of diverse scales- voting, writing letters to the editor, public hearing, deliberation, rallies, protests and social movements to realise their rights. But this discourse has prized lawyers and judges. The claim of rights expresses less concern for public good.

Similarly, the feeling for life has recognised a symbiosis between ecology and economy and production and exchange to meet survival needs. Political parties, civil society, NGOs and social media have improved the feedback between leaders and citizens. But the huge costs of their dependency, debt, delay and skewed or non-action in matters of projects are fading the national immune system. Auditor-General has suggested that INGOs need state regulation as they are running a "shadow economy" violating the laws, hiding huge money in banks and enriching kleptocratic networks thus reducing development indicators.

Though federal parliament has taken holiday from policy making and adopted all the policies originated from international institutions since the onset of modernity and democracy including the latest one the SDGs, local bodies are entrusted with the duty to execute most of them. They are, therefore, engaged in crafting policies, programmes and activities as per their needs, address their problems and steer development gear. Compared to States which act as intermediary, citizens' direct engagement in local bodies is growing. Social inclusion of women, Dalits, minorities and functional interest groups of society in the elected bodies provide scope to participate, interact with authorities, influence policy outcome in matters of selection of projects, allocation of resources, infrastructure development, management of environment and supply of public goods.

Active civic engagement is culturally rooted practices of Nepal. What is innovated is the use of emancipatory democratic values-freedom, scientific knowledge, human rights, civic autonomy, political voice and visibility, solidarity and peace. They tend to ground Nepali institutions in universalistic ethics and unleash social, economic and political energies for democratic development. It prevents the citizens' fall off of economic scale.

Assuming the public good as uppermost priority, development process can bring the state, polity, government, political parties, economic institutions and local bodies closer to citizens, increase their access to resources, institutions and agencies and enforce leaders' accountability. In Nepal, public good and services are supplied by the state's coercive means, private sector market exchange, co-sharing of cooperatives, voluntary mode of NGOs and community based bodies, donors' food for work and direct engagement of citizens which is cost-effective. It bypasses bureaucratic rut as citizens are producers, consumers, stakeholders and beneficiaries of development and, therefore, better state-citizen ties can liberate them from being passive recipients of welfare benefits common in a paternalistic regime.

But the centre-periphery tensions over their jurisdictions limp local bodies as the later are facing barriers to positive civic engagement owing to bigger sizes of Gaon Palikas and municipalities, geographic isolation of certain parts, reluctance of district officers to shift their works to local bodies, under supply of public servants, poor infrastructures, convoluted laws, loss of production dynamism owing to the migration of youths abroad, inexpert local authorities in matters of mediation of interests, conflict between elected and non-elected leaders and corruption of power. In some localities weak market institutions and strewn hamlets hinder the supplies while in remote areas where the presence of government is limited to administration, NGOs, civil society and market fail to meet the hope of citizens for development dividends.

In some localities, returnee migrant workers are doing innovative production works, such as poultry business, bee-keeping, commercial farming, horticulture, milk production, meat supply, organic farming, vegetable production, cash crops like tea, coffee, etc. fulfilling demand-supply equilibrium. Exposure has provided them development insights of other nations. Nepal has also offered training on vocational and technical education to enhance the stock of human resource. But it is insufficient to optimally exploit the nation's endowment. Citizens' practical engagement in labour, production, trade, finance, investment, technology and distribution is primal entailing modern tools to meet competitive standards. Similarly, various projects such as education, health, drinking water, sanitation, agriculture, cooperatives, infrastructures, farming techniques and small scale projects also require upgrading of technology.

Nepali leadership often flips to new theory of development to solve the nation's problems while citizens are socialised in unfilled promises. Each theory proved defunct to capture the diversity and complexity of Nepali society. Development experts, detached from social learning of the empirical reality, ignored the culture, knowledge and experience of citizens and remained insulated from the disturbing effects of their failures. Development rests not only on the use of capital, technology, market and materials but also human ingenuity to utilise what Elinor Ostrom calls "institutional incentive" without crippling the nature's gift for renewal. It optimises the sustainability of development.

Constitutional checks are vital to control obstreperous actors who spoil these conditions and get private benefits at public costs. The leaders need to revamp the failing institutions owing to the corrosive influence of interest groups, partisan politics and weak management, share the burden and benefits of common good with all Nepalis, craft dense associations to cultivate public spirit and common life of citizenship beyond private profit. Dispersal of power is vital but not enough unless they cultivate the virtue and skill, acquire wealth, power and specialisation for engagement in the public sphere of local commons and raise the scale of self-governance.

A strong doze of civic education for Nepalis is vital to liberate them from the Hobbesian trap, engage them in the civilisation process to pacify the wild human nature and uplift the quality of life by building citizens' civic capacity, mobilising local resource and cultivating human scale of community, society, organisation and national affinity crucial to cut the costs of development.

### Media in Democratization

Media - print, audio, visual and internet - form a part of larger civil society entrusted with the duty to protect human rights, widen the domain of public sphere and contribute to public opinion and democratic will-formation. Awakening of Nepalis to their constitutional rights and ethics of legal duties and their socialisation are keys to consolidate constitutional state capable of achieving governance goals. Nepali media have served vital tasks in democratic innovation and diffusion of its principles and concepts crucial to fortify its institutional pillars, such as polity, political parties, civil society, election and the public and projected national identity to a wider world of nation-states.
One of the oldest media in Nepal such as Gorkhapatra and its sister publication The Rising Nepal have always exposed Nepalis to new ways of thinking to build this nation through the flow of educational contents and adoption of new attitudes needed for social modernisation and economic progress. The recent effort of Gorkahpatra to fuse and adjust to the needs of diverse Nepalis and increase outreach in the periphery have animated the links with major segments of society through their own dialects, cultures and geniuses. Transmitting news, views and opinions across many divides is essential for democratic consciousness of citizens and revival of the public from the mass.

Communicative space
Proliferation of private media and online newspapers with diffused orientations and interest areas has widened the scope of communicative space for the voice and visibility of many groups of society, pooled new loyalties and indulged in competition for public attention. It is helping to maintain a balance between universal spirit of democracy and cultural relativism of Nepali nation. Many journalists imbued with virtuous ethics have fostered democratic spirit even at the risk of their life and liberty. Some are burdened by the source of funding and lack common Nepali sentiment. They are less articulator of public interests while others are more to side of democratic aspirations than constitutionalism.

An enduring moral question of democracy is that it entails healthy and free press to cultivate democratically worthy citizens for freedom of press is fused with social accountability. The normative values of Nepali democracy such as popular sovereignty, social inclusion and negative and positive rights supply creative spirit to politics so central to defend public interests. It enables the nation fit for the world culture. In Nepal, the public functions of media, however, rest on their own framework of ownership, finance, autonomy, control, regulation, transparency and accountability. Their context-sensitivity enables to rationally shape cognition, feeling, emotion and judgment about the state of Nepali democracy and foster legal-rational norms for leaders' behaviour.

As a champion of freedom Nepali media have provided civic awareness to citizens about changing nature of politics, equipped them with participatory information, stimulated active engagement and fostered meaningful dialogues. But in no way they are instrumental in providing ownership on public policies which are mostly fabricated outside the nation. Familiarisation of citizens with various themes hones their inner vigilance enabling to judge the rationality of democratic politics and exercise choice in public affairs. Nepali state can implement Right to Information Act, Working Journalists Act and the Constitution if it holds legitimate monopoly on power to create public order and clip the connectors of Nepali society.

But the protection of journalists' rights, laws, social security, professional dignity and solidarity are allied with the autonomy and capacity of the polity to tolerate independent role of the court, watchdog agencies and the attentive public. It enables media to serve as a lively link between the input and output functions of democracy which makes the interactive political sphere resilient. Solidarity of media associations helps to beat the abuse of their members, enforce labour act and security deficit caused by attack politics. Fragmentation of it along partisan lines stifles the public sphere and their own efficacy. Mediatisation of public sphere has enabled Nepali leaders to communicate more with journalists than among themselves and to the life of citizens.

Media Strategies for Democratisation: Critical information is power and its effective utilisation helps to free Nepalis from the fetters and tutelages and realisation of their 31 constitutional rights and four duties. Civic competence of Nepalis to shape preference rests on basic knowledge and access to the flow of information to the entire web of national life. The direct language media use for communication of the messages can socialise citizens on public issues, provide them autonomous power to deliberate and act without any fear of power constraint. The manifest performances of media on democratisation are:

First, detonation of critical debates in Nepal has birthed a deliberative public essential to keep the dynamic of political life. Informed public opinion depends on critical social dialogues about the conditions of Nepalis, women's issues, social evils, human trafficking, reform in social legislation, health and safety of poor, etc. Elimination of structural injustice can create a level playing field for all. Nepali media thus need to debate about impersonal roles of the state and public institutions, political parties, market and civil society taking into account long-term perspectives of all sides on the political process beyond project setup. This is central to reflect the plurality of opinions and diversity of views and stimulate creative participation of the public in the attainment of common good.

Second, the public sphere of media is ideally regarded autonomous of various interest groups so that every Nepali can share this sphere equally and exercise their right to know ensuring decisions on public affairs transparent. Pluralist character of Nepali media has enabled citizens to shape their political choices and pass valid judgment. By using reflective imagination and deliberation with ordinary citizens they can bridge the gap between their concepts and citizens' world views and engage them in revealing the social truth above the cacophonous noise. A responsible media culture can reform many irrational codes of society and create rational ground to step up social change.

Third, Nepali media continue to activate the passive spectators into active citizens. To be engaged in public affairs means actively express political, legal and policy issues on media platforms creating a stake of every Nepali in democracy. One vital democratic role of media is civic education-- training of Nepalis into the life of citizenship and human rights, respect for others' legitimate views and work for the improvement of government and public institutions. Democratisation helps to broaden their horizon, moderate the views of many identities- caste, class, gender, ethnicity, religions and regions and transform them into an equal citizen of Nepal. Those with partisan prejudice do not generate true consciousness. Instead they indoctrinate, engineer consent, inflate the image of leaders or indulge in disinformation. They are problematic in terms of attaching the trust and loyalty of citizens to democracy.

Fourth, Nepali media have functioned as generators of public trust, reconciliation and peace. The worst affected citizens by direct violence, disruption and structural injustice are poor Nepalis though tax and remittance they contribute to keep the nation's vital economic life going. In a post-conflict nation, like Nepal, media have to pro-actively engage in reformist agenda, shape common backdrop order for a common ground for the resolution of constitutional issues such as type of polity, federalism, governance, judiciary, election, citizenship and democratic dividends. It defines media profession as a normative public craft to expand civic space to capture the soul of democratic values and norms. Resilient functions of media in Nepal rest on non-violent communication and nurturing of bonding and bridging social capital for deepening democracy.

Fifth, bulk of public interest media in Nepal has served to liberate citizens from alien-thought control, feudalism and corporate interest. Democratic politics is not only about the leadership selection for power but also about promoting common good where even ordinary citizens are beneficiary. The robustness of Nepali democracy rests on an easy flow of feedback between the leaders and citizens and revitalisation of public life. Media should release democracy's capacity for social, economic and political integration of society, strengthen national integrity system to control social evils, corruption and impunity control of which make surplus for social investments for livelihood security.

Sixth, public function of Nepali media is to build civic competence of citizens to adapt to ecological, economic and technological change. Information and education provide means for nurturing citizens' life-long learning process with the flow of changes. In this sense, the contents of civic education should be practical in nature because it gives them a critical sense of inquiry in thinking, judgment and action. A democratic process also avoids the pitfall of exclusion and eternal agitation cursing Nepal. Civic space of media freedom is guaranteed in Nepal's constitution. But it is law-based, not lawless and anarchic, which requires civic culture of media persons.

Nepali media have a long-standing promise to a civic culture, a culture that requires not only political equality but also an ability to solve their problems and contribute to social modernisation and democratisation. Fundamentalism, whether market, class, ethnic or religious, removes the common ground among the diverse Nepalis living together in the same space, stokes the spiral of mistrust, distorts communication and risks the nation's relapse into pre-civilised form. The ability of media to inculcate knowledge about the optimisation of concerns of various actors can fortify democratic public life.

Nepalis should be given critical knowledge about changing the nature of ecology, technology, economy and life-choices. Only then, democracy can foster peace through every one's stake in it and instils a sense of justice. Injustice, alienation and invisibility mark the decline of democracy and an atrophy of media's public functions to make democracy for everyone by reaching to even the passive, poor, isolated and alienated ones and engaging in civic action. By providing critical information responsible press nurtures an informed society capable of making vital choices in the public affairs and contributes towards participatory democracy.

### Public Security and Democracy

The health of any society is linked to safe and sound environment. A key factor determining public security is the state of national security and global situation. Public security is a public good. No one can be barred from its benefits. It can flourish on the solidarity of the public with security agencies. Democracy as a rule rests on public trust, freedom of citizens from vital needs and their intrepid expression of opinion. Leadership gains legitimacy if it can fulfil them and realise citizens' right to secure life. Safe and secure citizens are those who do not feel threatened and whose life, liberty, property and pursuit of pleasure are fully secured. In Nepal absence of trust paralyses collective action and terribly affects the poor because they have less means to secure themselves. Growing mistrust lurches the power of civil society to regenerate impulse of civility. Democracy provides Nepali citizens a chance to test whether their sovereignty preserved in the Constitution of Nepal is real or rhetorical and their rights practical or legal only. They are the nerves of a decent life. In security deficits democracy turns flawed and sets off a state of nature and scarcity of public goods hitting the civility of society.

Fatal gaps
Nepalis suffer from two fatal gaps between the changing social order and weak governance to manage and aspiration-fed citizens and frailty of civic institutions to satisfy them. Rule of law can contribute to physical and psychological security in Nepal if its polity holds institutional muscle to provide social justice. Public security is linked to macro national security which is now beset by multi-level tensions lack of which stokes predatory forces to free ride. At micro level, it is linked to safe family and community milieu, secure roads, access to education and health, regulatory system to responsive politics. Anti-constitutional activities of various actors strain orderly rule in Nepal. The shortfall of public security fed by the infectious partisanisation of discipline creating agencies can only be remedied by their political neutrality and gaining the soul, the public support. As a result, a gap exists between the existing levels of public security in Nepal and what the regime ought to do urgently. Only a coherent plan can match the scale for securing citizens.

The causes of insecurity in Nepal are both intra-systemic and extra-systemic. Nepal's Home Ministry has identified 33 groups of various hues including armed outfits posing diverse scale of concerns. The scope of public security is scaling up in proportion to the increase of many sources of contagious risks. Its scarcity is evident from the fact that women, judges, journalists, officials, political leaders, business community and ordinary citizens demand for it. National security deficits have prompted VIPs to have more security staff these days than a decade ago and the private security agencies have thrived to protect the powerful, their wealth and enterprises surrounded by warning devices, guards and guns. Concentration of opportunity in sprawling towns have added newer risks-poverty, joblessness, crime, violence against women and girls, theft, drug abuse, growth of small arms, kidnapping, extortion, etc. They have disarmed Nepali democracy from its substance.

The organised crimes linked to grand corruption and pressure on coalition government to tolerate elite- run syndicate, monopoly, capital flight, tax-evasion etc provide the structural reasons for it. Crimes as proxy factors of violence are linked to macro milieu which can cause severe civic exhaustion - anomie, chaos and erosion of authority offering scope for looting of public wealth and flouting societal norms. Nepal's old disease is the treatment of effects, not the causes, which nastily bred the virus of insecurity. The growth of many channels of political socialisation in Nepal indicates enlarged communicative skill of citizens and use of technology. It provides a basis for the civil society to reflect on the condition of Nepalis, raise awareness, invent tools, manage technology-induced risks and spur safety measures for their lives and property. The government's dialogue team has initiated talks while Defense Ministry is holding informal consultation on how to improve national security through an updated security policy.

The sources of insecurity in Nepal stem from the erosion of the state's monopoly on power. It limped its ability to control threats, coercion, anti-social activities, gender violence and alleviate livelihood crisis. Identity politics has reduced the idea of a political community rooted on citizenship and dragged the capacity of polity to create secure environment. Information revolution has turned democracy along participatory line of the affected citizens generating tension with the representative democracy, its institutions and political culture. The surge of the tools of violence, such as armed groups, thieves, militant wings of parties, criminals and abuses of human rights with impunity continues unabated. In the absence of integrated law-enforcing system to enforce constitutional behaviour of all actors, it cannot build a trust across the nation's divides. In a country of minority, politics based on power equation alienates the Others. Public security has also suffered from porous border, limited resources of security agencies, sophisticated techniques used by criminals, poor information system and weak coordination between civil-security relations. In this sense, elites need to work on bonding forces of society and combat the violence targeting the public. Self-censorship of media, human rights bodies and security agencies induced either by profit incentive or partisan politics reduces them to a mere spectator and stoke a culture of pessimism and silence among the insecure section of Nepalis.

Public security is the duty of the state's public officials. But they fail to turn effective without upholding the integrity of office supported by watchful eyes of citizens. In Nepal, public institutions are weak and social and economic order is fractured by the erosion of hard institutions of the state—military, armed police force, police, intelligence and public administration responsible for a robust security. Psychological safety emerges from the soft power--vigilant public, media, civil society and attentive citizens. They supply early warning of social risks, spawn critical information and build opinion, preference and policy. It is vital to create business-friendly environment. Active citizens can act as a watchdog of political power and carry out their innovative pursuits. Their right to information makes democracy a responsive rule. Informed dialogue across the nation's diverse spectrum is absolutely essential to build trust, bridge the factors that split them and heal and reconcile this nation's sores.

The politics of moderation between capitalism and communism is the way to manage the appetite of both to consume each other or collusion for shared benefits and elevate the outlook of identity crazy groups into a larger national sphere. Building trust across the Nepali citizens can surpass the elites' penchant to parochialism, re-tribalisation of society and indulgence in post-modern tumult justifying vicious politics. The role of Nepali civil society remains supreme in circulating the civic education and inspiring their active engagement in national construction. It is a key pillar for lifting the design of public security of Nepal. The community police-citizen interface is a fine example.

Nepali media daily report the overall health of the state and society. If the level of insecurity grows, the indicator of early warning moves up. Disinformation generates distrust across the empirical divides hostile to security, stability and social peace. Public alertness about the changing national context is a heady way to reduce conflict-induced insecurity. Awareness about the civility among leaders and security agencies builds bedrock of trust and radiates to every corner of Nepali society. Transparency of business investment is essential for the democratisation of information, capital and business houses and resolves the tri-lemma between media freedom and security of journalists, professionalism and social responsibility and access to information and credibility of news, views and information pertaining to public security.

Those engaged in security mainly police and public administration await three critical roles: monitor anti-social groups, drive actionable intelligence from the investigative media and attentive citizens and build strong ties with the community. A modicum of public security in Nepal demands a synergy of hard institutions of the state which carry the sanity of tradition and soft social capital of society which is helpful for the adaptation of the state to both popular aspiration and the shifting nature of global security architecture. National leadership has to adopt both preventive and remedial measures to allay insecurity and enforce a responsive rule. A peaceful environment requires building a nexus between security, democracy and progress and mitigation of general fear of citizens about the condition in which they live. The performance of security agencies rests on their autonomy, efficiency, impersonality and capacity to provide surveillance and act ably.

Civic surveillance
Spreading out of the circles of security from individual to institutional and larger macro level can pass public trust through the watchful eyes of Nepalis. Civic surveillance makes it preventive and cost-effective while pre-emptive and response-ready security deployment deters the evils' offensive. The promotion of integrity system of all actors through accountability measures set norms for the fulfilment of shared expectation and build integrated horizontal and vertical social capital. The creation of a strong national centre is vital to spur centripetal forces and secure heartland, strategic areas, buffers and frontiers. It provides them a chance to form networks in the community and cut security risks. Stronger ties act as a bridge across citizens and synchronise conduct. To meet its rising challenges, responsible civil society should be made effective to enforce citizens' solidarity with the state and their collective action.

### Ethics of Political life

The ethics of political life refers to its qualities of being right, honest, non-corrupt, fair and good. It is entrenched in representative, legitimate, transparent and accountable governance which makes bribery a high-risk venture. This ethical life becomes weak if thieves of Nepali society and the state rob citizens of their equitable future. The media daily reveal that both are heavily infected with the toxic elements - corruption, crime, deceit, amorality and abuse of authority. The cardinal virtue of ethics is wisdom. Politics, however, universally unfolds a paradox: combative human nature collides with human rationality and a shared sense of civic responsibility. Political realists hold grim view of human nature. It creates a circle of affective bond around selfish genes. On the opposite side of life, idealists believe in social nature of human beings. The universal human reason feeds prudential rule and breathe the ardour of ultimate values.

Here ethical life seeks a balance between self-interest and care to others. Nepal's constitution has integrated rights, laws and morality. The invention of human rights aims at taming egoism and lift moral standard for the greater good of citizens. It is a path to cooperation for security, stability and peace among citizens and nation-states. Optimal freedom can shape decent behaviour for the formation of a culture to bind selfish individuals to a common vision. Personal ethics of Nepali leaders can snuff out the malaises of politics and crack the spell of hazy practice imperilling the governing rule.

Certain ideals set politics to ethical edge. First, ethical politics balances the conflicting desires of diverse Nepali citizens without excluding any one from the public good. Good life promised in the Constitution of Nepal cannot be divorced from their abject living condition. Second, ethical politics is not vacuous. It demands virtuous character of leadership capable of innovating good public policies, laws and actions and fulfilling promises, rights, needs and duties underlined in the Constitution. Third, ethical politics seeks the compatibility of means and ends of a welfare state. It treats Nepalis an end in themselves, not means to each other's benefit. It wires the sanctity of human life which market fans and seditious politicians often miss. Fourth, ethical politics views that liberty of pleasure rests on apt dispensation of political order assuring the integrity and dignity of Nepalis so that they are not vulnerable to violence, insecurity, poverty and scarcity caused by dysfunctional polity. The dignity of Nepalis can be ethically justified and morally defended. It pertains to the integrity of democratic polity. Fifth, ethical politics values human life above other values such as power, authority, legitimacy, position, wealth, etc. fitted to grasp the purpose of life.

Inculcation of ethics allows Nepalis to exercise conscious choice of good over the bad. Nepal has adopted education for all, labour rights, gender equality, abolition of social discrimination and protection of weak and environment. Education can make them better off if institutions and norms of the nation are utilised to erase the pains of everyday life and remove causes of misery. This means economic values must be compatible with educational policies and practices and development gaps do not skew the sharing of commonwealth by all citizens. The social psychology of citizens is that they compare themselves with others. This is why winner-takes-all society is prone to overload of public demands, instability and conflict. Nepal's constitution has, therefore, stressed on increased social spending, social security and social justice for the poor. Still, unfulfilled electoral promises and rights prick moral conscience of leaders.

Ethics embeds all Nepalis on public spirit to share a sense of civic pride by controlling the lever of power caught in a callous division of spoils of weak statecraft. Nepal's demand for justice in the global arena can be ethically justified if its internal order is grounded in the frame public decency. This entails the art of governance defined by its positive outcome to all citizens. But corruption dilutes this by an exit of those in authority from the accepted standard in pursuit of illicit profit. Nepal's recent history is beset with policy corruption, patronage, gifts, kickbacks and theft of international aid. This has swelled the costs of progress in Nepal. The thin line between accepted behaviour and unauthorised personal windfall gain will continue if public policies do not have ownership and relevance.

Controlling the inner virus of Nepali polity is vital for pumping economic efficiency, political accountability and judicial fairness. Vices permeate into individual life when one prefers to live beyond one's means either through bribery or stealing of public funds. Nepal's institutional decay is attributed to the deviation of public officials and elected representatives from the fidelity of its goals and indulging in greed. If cultural industries are conscripted to heaping praise for self-indulging corrupts, they echo nothing but an atrophy of civic sense.

The delivery of public goods and services to citizens is the ethical duty of a government. In Nepal, its efficacy necessitates capacity building, result-orientation, public participation and the promotion of national integrity by a right checks and balance of the polity's institutional poise. This cuts the abuse of authority and leakages of national wealth. Predatory corruption whether minor, based on the survival need of low paid officials or huge ones involving higher authorities at policy level reminds what Prithvi N. Shah said, "bribe takers and givers are enemies of the nation." Such monetary accretion does not go to productive reinvestment, but to foreign banks or foreign investments, infinite consumption of luxury items and distortion of management practices.

In public sector contracting, the costs of corruption are reflected in the waste of scarce resources, misallocation and bad practices. The economic cost of corruption in Nepal have exhausted political muscle and bred many corrosive practices: procuring high cost goods, tax-evasion, bank defaulting, rent-seeking, selling of profit making state enterprises, decision in favour of fruitless project, rising cost of goods and gradual entrapment of the nation in the odious debt and misery of ordinary Nepalis. Where bureaucratic corruption is institutionalised, officials do not hold their jobs in high esteem. In case of low salary, promotion fails to motivate them. Rather, tendency appears in foreign travel and fake payment. In an oligarchic polity with a multiple source of syndicate, bribery flourishes in revenue branch, law enforcement office, public utility sector and within the same office by superiors where services are slow without bribe.

Nepalis are appalled by the nation ranking high in the firmament of global perception index tormenting ethical life and wrecking public works. When corruption turns out to be systematic, it is hard to check it without reforming the symbiosis of business, bureaucracy and politics, ending impunity for grand offenses against public and national interests and protecting the Nepalis from law breakers--predators, thieves and armed actors. Unless top Nepali leaders imbibe Seven Principles of Public Life invented by Lord Nolan, such as selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership and institutional culture, the ethical political life cannot get robust footing. Public programmes afflicted with bribery require defiant action of CIAA, Auditor General, parliamentary committees and intelligence unit, not tearful confession of lack of laws.

Financial integrity cannot be beefed up without a political will of the government, access to information and a vibrant public sphere to escalate the cost of abusing ethical life. Anti-corruption watchdogs need to probe the fairness of the decisions and the duty of public officials. Ideally, the National Election Commission can deter corrupt and criminals' participation in the polity and make leaders accountable to the ethical life. Civil societies also have a vested interest in detecting the illicit tricks of public officials and mobilising citizens to cry for justice. They can become effective if judiciary serves as a guardian of the public interest and does not bow down to the executive in withdrawing cases of major offenses. Nepal's Constitution has included right to information which makes media's central role in enforcing the accountability of leaders to the public interest and monitoring their deviation from a wide range of policy issues including aid infusion to conditionalised policy and geopolitical plot.

Integrity of Nepal's political life requires integrated solution - citizens' abiding defence of public institutions, their mutual checks on power and effective civic bodies, such as media, civil society and anti-corruption watchdogs to align with them in fighting the amorality of life. Constitutionalisation of behaviour of all actors and democratisation of parties can reduce political vices arising out of the deinstitutionalisation of the polity and weakening of civic life. It is feasible to infuse ethics into politics and enforce a moral standard in Nepali society, economy and polity through education, socialisation and strong civic activism. Ethical base of Nepali polity demands the strengthening of criminal justice system. Execution of law through legislature, making binding decisions of public will and enthusing in politics social solidarity and compassion are vital steps so that ill-gotten private wealth does not disrupt moral feeling of noble hearts of family, community and educational institutions to foster the ethical standards of political life.

### Usefulness of Civic Education

The idea of civic education embraces liberation of people from their infantile thinking, belief and behaviour. It transforms them from biological origin to social and then to cosmological spheres awakening them to the fact that different people are not too dissimilar to learn from each other's experience. Civic consciousness, like glow of light, razes all fallacies revealing citizen's life beyond the needs of body and mind. Practically, it publicises them with democratic theories, laws, institutions and rights to match the variation of material condition and duties holding each other accountable for their action. A national curriculum and praxis of education can enable Nepalis to acquire high quality of knowledge, virtues and skill to perform their tasks and build character which is crucial to peacefully engage in the nation's life. Nepalis live in a plurality of life-world who share the common state with the natives, core values of shared humanity with other humans and a common Earth with other living species that define their duties beyond self and attain universal emancipation. Innovated by sages, its past tradition of enlightenment was not elitist in nature. It sought the perfection of good life unblinked by the siren call of fundamentalism, fatalism, unsocialised animal spirit and populism of today.

Enlightenment values, shaped by the knowledge of light, were based on punya karma (good action), not only human reason and will for self-promotion. They enabled Nepalis to engage in improving life, acquire a worldview and gain ability for self-decision. Those devoid of them are dictated by others and cannot be said free citizens able to solve their personal and social problems and contribute to democracy consolidation in Nepal. Astavakra Gita reveals the nature of Atma Gyan (internal vigilance measured as a precondition to liberty) which has the drive to transcend unsocial human nature. Social virtue is essential to bridge the gap between knowledge and wisdom and order and free will and build human affinity enriching good character. For Gautam Buddha, the path to dharma is a way to the bliss of nirvana, a way that frees humans from the karmaic cycle of suffering, impermanence of life and impersonality of phenomenon and link inner self to a single universe. It helped to detribalise Nepali society. Production of good citizens is the core of civic education affirmed by Socrates in the West and Buddha in the East as a source of polity fit for peace. Nepal's Constitution and policy document too stress on civic education for every citizen though the modern path to it is lost in the din of contesting ideologies, strategies and manoeuvres. As a result, Nepali families prefer successful children, no matter good or bad. The ironies of too much rights, few duties and poor material resources have kept Nepali politics into a combustible gear. This shows that modern Nepali leaders need to confront the nation's future with the ideals of the past defined in the spirit of middle path. Science has linked diverse citizens but did not cultivate the civility to achieve common good.

Immanuel Kant says, "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one's own understanding without the guidance of another." He says that this inability arises from the lack of courage to exercise freedom. He speaks of three-fold tutelage or immaturity: domestic socialisation where children are dependent on the advice of parents and elders every time and follow their judgments in every aspect of life rather than becoming capable of using their intellect and creativity; civil tutelage of law, leaders and teachers whereby adults uncritically imbibe and faithfully obey their orders and authority without questioning their rationality; and life-long stage of pious tutelage of religious scripts and priests that dominate their belief and behaviour. Each sort of tutelage depoliticises citizens, fosters conformist political culture and kills their sovereign power to uphold inquiring mind to solve their problems created by political stasis and inexorable tides of globalisation. Nepalis cannot exercise their sovereignty so long as they are divorced from the native tradition of enlightenment which looks timelessly modern but now vulnerable to the glitter of modernity's materialism which has reduced media, schools, culture, health, nature, security and law into consumer goods undermining the civic health of the nation. The enchantment with the instrumental nature of reason has undermined the emancipatory potential of enlightenment and punished the weaker part of Nepali society.

The praxis of civic education evokes practical ends of human sensibilities. Its reflective awareness on lived experience of citizens enable them to self-legislate, build personal integrity and national character and become stakeholders of democracy. Inability of Nepali leaders to spread civic virtues has converted citizens into an unreflective mass who impulsively jubilate every regime change, democratic or not as they judge it from existential possibility. The critique of this praxis is vital to transform Nepalis of diverse social, economic and geographic origins into equal citizens and hone their talent of judgment. Praxis cannot be governed by only scientific or rationalistic knowledge claims which is deterministic in nature but by choice-based normative, ethical and moral belief. Nepalis have wisdom of ‘common sense' judgment of every day practices. On the basis of this, they participate in community, local assemblies, organise public action, engage in the production, circulation and exchange of vital goods and fulfil their needs and rights. A society that displays ample civic virtues can make their milieu clean and do not look down to cleaners as socially inferior in caste, gender or status. It breaks the barriers to work together in pursuit of the nation's overall progress.

Liberty exists in the gift of critical judgment about ideological blindness, demagogic illusion, irrationality and determinism of class, caste, gender, ethnicity and locality. Education divorced from real life experience of citizens disables them to reflect, engage and influence societies, politics, law and economic planning. In this sense, the rebellious spirit of Nepalis against their subordination to organised power is vital to realize the Constitutional vision of "an egalitarian society." Civic competence unfolds the choices to Nepalis to confront, not just during election but in every turn of life and influence vital policies that affect their lives. It fosters a sense of social equality, tolerance of opposing voice, builds trusts and gears up the spirit of public action. Frank Bruni says, "It is dangerous to forget that in a democracy, college is not just about making better engineers but about making better citizens, ones whose eyes have been opened to the sweep of history and spectrum of civilisation." Those suffering from historical amnesia are hardly inspired by the example of ancestors, their temper and spirit of national freedom. John Dewey says that human nature is not fixed. Civic education and associated life determine human conduct. They nurture civic virtues of individuals that underpin justice based social order. De-culturation, by contrast, is alienating. In this context, social modernisation in Nepal supposes freedom for all. Civic culture bears three effects: growth of individuality, freedom of choice and personal accountability in the entire cycle of life. The last one enables Nepalis to cultivate social virtues of trust, tolerance and teamwork to fight endless causes of the nation's marginality.

Nepalis, as public citizens, are members of the state. They are free to take any initiatives not constrained by habit, tradition and arbitrary actions of authorities. Civic learning means not the passive absorption of lifeless facts or passage of text books written in a totally alien context. It is about engaging in active reflection and inquiry on the life-context of Nepalis, their everyday issues, actors and rules to resolve problems. A vibrant democracy requires active citizenship. It brings cognitive and affective attachment to Nepali democracy, nourishes their openness and engages them in the philosophical traditions for the renewal of national order without smothering the capacity of society for reunion and resilience to the changing times. A common citizenship can transcend the primitive differences shaped and institutionalised by political parties, their liberating fronts and the Constitution. It can create a shared condition for judgment about the art and outcome of polity. Rational choice has failed to control egoism entailing the rediscovery of its enlightenment to rebuild the state from the societal muscle.

Enlightened Nepalis have the guts to defy myth and capricious practices and articulate in public sphere. It frees them from inferiority complex denying their human potential and constitutional propensity. The inversion of Nepal's enlightenment tradition through radical political and social engineering has bred gutless elites. Inorganic intellectuals and leaders are disembodied from the episteme of national culture, history and life-world. They hardly learn from their experience. They are weak to indigenise universal knowledge to fit to local conditions. Ideology-driven education creates ignorant person. Consent manufacturing by unfair media while thought-and-body control of legislators during crucial parliamentary voting denied them from using conscience. Artificial awareness makes it easy to abuse mini identities against the Nepali state and wane social cohesion. Undemocratic leaders fear that civic education fades their superior status and, therefore, seek loyal clients and cadres, not free citizens.

Nepali state has made great strides in the domain of social inclusion and increased women's rights—reproduction, equal parental property and authority, non-exploitation, non-discrimination, social inclusion in politics and administration and positive discrimination in education, health, income-generation, security and peace-promotion activities marking towards participatory democracy. Equal rights to grant citizenship to their children in their name, gender budgeting, appreciation of their family work and zero tolerance to violence can widen the civic circle of life and remove the remaining impediments. This means learning of universal standards and laws can change attitude, capacitate Nepali women for leadership and close the gender gaps in vital sphere of life. Promotion of cardinal civic virtues such as moderation, patience and wisdom is vital for a plural society like Nepal for reconciliation of various identities through the delight of new lens. The transmission of these virtues to many generations of citizens can give impetus to those native civic values of giving, charity, healing and safeguarding social peace. It renews social ties, engineers democracy from below and gives Nepalis a chance to converse with power elites in equal terms. This is vital to create a common ground for public action and foster normative consensus over democratic values across the political parties of various hues to repair state-citizenship ties.

### Duties of Citizen and State

A good society cannot be created only by rights without any social duties and accountabilities. To Immanuel Kant, acting according to duty means to "obey the law" legislated by citizens or their deputies as rational beings. Government officials have well-defined duties to compulsorily perform, which creates credibility and trust in them. Citizens also have determinate duties expected to be fulfilled by means of their dharma of volunteerism, vigilant defence of public sphere and institutions that enable them to converse on critical issues and discover measure to solve them on the optimal interest of all sides.

In Nepal, civic duties embrace worldly legal, moral and practical obligations of citizens. The Constitution has entitled them with many welfare rights, which oblige the state to fulfil and engage in mutually helpful international cooperation and perform cosmopolitan duties. The modern rights have replaced Hindu-Buddhist concept of vigilant interiority, atma gyan, which is central to the character building of leaders and citizens. This concept provides them freedom to use public reason and right to rebel against unjust rule.

In democracy, duties correspond to rights where the state and citizens are bound by mutual obligations civilised by socialisation, communication and nationalisation. It transcends selfish human nature, which seeks to govern the weak by depriving their dignity, nationality and humanity. A balance between rights and duties can bring the Nepali society to the cardinal virtue of middle path and build social solidarity.

The Constitution of Nepal makes citizenship to Nepali citizens an indispensable right by virtue of their nationality. Nepali citizenship is acquired through: jus sanguine, descent, jus soli birth, domicile residence, marriage, diasporas and honorary grounds. The last three types have allowed non-territorial dimension of citizenship. There are non-territorial groups such as citizens of other countries yet tracing Nepali roots and upholding its identity and cultural affinity of oneness and wholeness while six million Nepali youths in the global labour markets exercising some form of post-national citizenship though they have limited labour rights, less dignity and fewer choices relative to those living within the nation. Guest workers are fulfilling national utility while refugee's status is governed by "gentlemen agreement" with external leviathan. Both are excluded from political participation. The tradition of citizenship in Nepal is tied to a practice of closure along national line and linked to nationality.

Nepali Constitution deems citizen and the state sovereign entities bound by reciprocal loyalties and duties. It spells out 31 rights from the right to life, liberty, education, health, property, social security and work to food sovereignty and four duties to Nepali citizen: safeguard the nationality, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state, remain loyal to it, abide by the Constitution and law, render compulsory service needed by the state and protect and preserve public property. Good citizenship is constructed by the cultivation of civic virtues, art of association and distribution of power in decision making across the populace for local self-governance. In Nepal, the rights-based legal culture of citizenship has shifted from immutable stage to contractual ones at all levels from marriage, company, civil society, political parties, state to global governance.

Duties of Nepali citizens are less elaborative, for example, it does not refer to the duty to pay tax, caste vote during election, inform about the crime to law enforcement agency, maintain public decency, uphold the spirit of patriotism, engage in public action, maintain social harmony and peace, etc. This implies that caring public and national interests is the shared duty of Nepalis and their state. When the sovereign space of political community, the Nepali state, erodes through globalisation from above and proliferation of autonomous forces below it drains emotional bond and ignites the surge of tribalism with its scorn for the sanity of native wisdom of tolerance of diverse culture. The logic of globalisation operates under the law of economic efficiency, not democracy and, therefore, Nepal must devise an integrated political response to negotiate new challenges.

The state, based on a civic culture of citizenship, is best suited for stable democracy, no matter whether the rule is unitary or multi-level. What it needs is the government of law and free watchdogs, including judiciary able to control the abuse of institutions, laws, rights and duties and accelerate resolution and reconciliation. The legitimate monopoly on power of Nepali state is vital to enforce Constitution spawning a vault of hope for stability and progress. Citizens differ from clients and consumers. The former are tied by the impersonal bond of nationality and seek common good while the latter seek to satisfy private interests. The consolidation of Nepali state demands active and positive citizenship able to utilise democracy's ingenious energy and invent legitimate demands to polity.

The art of agile and active citizenship with an awareness of enlightenment, rules, rights and duties and the legitimate source of state power can exert pressure on the leadership to formulate good laws and public policies beneficial to common good. Their apathy, however, weakens the community, society, polity and the state in the same way as inactive cadres enfeeble political parties or civil society's vital energy.

A society with many rights and few duties like in Nepal creates condition of social disequilibrium affecting both social cohesion and system integration. It undercuts democracy's material force. Stable national identity in Nepal is important for the management of its diverse caste, ethnic, linguistic, religious and geographical dispositions so that they do not harbour centrifugal inclinations or nurse irredentism vitiating geopolitical pressure. Duties of citizen provide collective national sentiment for patriotism, a sort of bridging and bonding social capital and their equal stake in the state. The duties of Nepali leaders lies in rescuing politics from parochial fear of scarcity and exclusion and restless struggle for power in the face of powerlessness of citizens by mobilising the forces of national unity.

Nepali state is fiscally and institutionally feeble to perform its entire duties without its capacity enhancement, integrity and an ability to pacify tools of violence. Unfulfilled rights erode the legitimacy of the government and polity, if not the state. Nepali state is also burdened with many international duties.

In this context, Nepali state has to formulate certain policies for the congruence of society, economy and polity and mediate between legal equality and condition of inequality of citizens. The abolition of a gap between constitutional ideal of an egalitarian society and empirical condition that defies it is vital to liberate Nepalis from their primordial identities and loyalties and construct national identity fused in popular sovereignty and state sovereignty.

Group enclosed rights foster subsidiary identity politics and cuts the concept of popular sovereignty embedded in individual and human rights what J. J. Rousseau calls "the will of all." In Nepal, citizens are socially constituted and continuously penetrated by partisan politics, Hindu-Buddhist and other religions, glitter of modernity and soft power of powerful countries. The choices made by them are, therefore, not free from their background conditions. Democratic culture diffuses duties to many institutions to whet public spiritedness for a common background condition for all. Nepali leadership needs to coordinate them under administration, institutions, rules, rights and duties inspiring citizens to work together on the basis of cultural and historical memories of national independence.

### Rule of Law or Rule of Justice ?

The question of what is just and unjust has plagued the minds of scholars and statesman since ancient time. It has been analysed in both universalistic and culturally relativist terms and on the basis of evolving values of progress, human rights and constitutional state. Legal construction of public order where institutions embody social justice enables citizens' support each other for collective gain. It cultivates civic virtues, attitudes and dispositions necessary to shape their habits to follow laws and judgment. Rights of citizens embedded in the constitution are connected to laws and duties aiming to improve the standards of living. The right-based culture, however, elevates coercive shadow of law over justice and morality and supports organised class of citizens while Nepal's politics, society and economy are predominantly unorganised and informal. They lack political agencies for collective action.

In this context, adoption of just polices and doing the right things are measured not simply by economic costs and benefits or utilitarian balance of pain and pleasure but by the intrinsic dignity of all Nepalis irrespective of their caste, class, gender, age, occupation or religious convictions and distinctions. Juergen Habermas argues that legal positivism is not apt for substantive democracy because it ignores social context and remains insensitive to the threat of vested interests which poses difficulty in turning political power responsive to citizens.

The popular sovereignty inscribed in the Constitution of Nepal enables them to leap into history and take charge of their own destiny through self-determination and local self-governance. Trust in the Constitution roots democratic ethos of judicial interpretation of its text with a broad understanding of its spirit without forgetting the condition of ordinary Nepalis and lending them empathy. Nepali courts can properly adjudicate the will of citizens as the bases of the law of the nation and government's legal-rational authority, if not dominated by wealthy classes. It encourages the marginalised, women, Dalits and the poor to strive for freedom and equality attuned to public international laws. The issues in Nepal are: how laws act on those poor who cannot afford to pay the fees of layers in the court in defence of their cases? How can the democratic idea of majority decision as final judge be consistent with republican tradition of popular sovereignty or "categorical imperative" of moral law articulated by Immanuel Kant?

Rule of law, an application of formalised norms and rules for all, under condition of poverty, hierarchy and patriarchy cannot satisfy Nepalis' all constitutional rights. In this context laws, as impersonal procedures and enforceable norms, hardly settle rival experiences, values, interests and choices of Nepalis divided by geography, income, social status, education and technology unless common goods are available to all. The deliberative mode of constitution making in Nepal through Constituent Assembly has been expected to reflect its plural traditions of enlightenment and synthesise all the viewpoints of society. Deliberative mode of legislation is the most rational. It helps citizens settle their legitimate public policy concerns in a golden mean. Nepalis' destiny can be realised by overcoming social evils - poverty, corruption and fatalism affirming equal opportunity and balancing majority rule by human rights of minority.

Nepal's every political party, civil society, economic and social organisations and the state promise justice to citizens. Do they have institutional and material means to fulfil it or muddle around the power equation and parliamentary coalition of majority? The rule of justice demands the fulfilment of promises and capacitating Nepali state to meet entitlement costs. Otherwise, it stokes a crisis of trust and loss of faith of citizens. The convoluted laws, devoid of procedural rationality, opens loopholes and multiple interpretations by legal experts and incoherent verdicts beyond egalitarian spirit of class compromise. Regular inputs from deliberative public to the legislature and courts democratise laws affirming justice.

Rule of justice has broader scope than the rule of law. It means granting Nepali citizens what they deserve for the realisation of their self-worth and underlies their freedom in the pursuit of their welfare gains. But it limits the freedom within certain boundaries to make it congruent with the general welfare of human beings. Rule of justice seeks to judge laws, society, politics and economy on their consistency with equity, fairness and dignity. Nepal's underused portfolios of natural, cultural and human resources are ample to enhance progress vital for material basis of justice. But it requires their optimal management, clever use of productivity boosting technology and performing public administration able to energise multitude of public, private, community, civil society, NGOs and voluntary service providers with a rainbow of choices to Nepalis. Fairness entails taxing the wealthy to aid the poor so that their solidarity can make a society of stakeholders cooperative.

The rule of justice is desirable state of affairs for enhancing many levels of social security and corrective and distributive justice to Nepalis so that social contracts at every level of society are glued by mutual obligations. But their lax enforcement is caused by fractious leaders, powerful interest groups, lobby, economic monopoly, predators and forces of globalisation. They skew the goal of Constitution to create an egalitarian society though increased social rights, coordination of public, private and cooperative economy for socialism and group equalisation through differentiated rights promise. These are vital steps to win votes and expand the welfare basis of government.

Citizens' opportunity for inclusion, proportional representation, job, education, health and care at various span of life adds new strategy to promote their good life so that they defend public order, social cohesion and peace. Nepal's welfare state seeks to balance welfare growth in respect to individual freedom and sovereign equality but too many rights without matching contribution and duties can impose overload on the state. It can breed dependency and feline disaffection among its citizens. The swollen political classes keep feeding themselves without performing good governance public interests, rebound sclerotic economy animating the spirit of justice and prevent the risks of turning of Nepalis into welfare clients.

So long as rule of law in Nepali is opened to politics and played without mutual accountability and respect among leaders, civic engagement in opinion formation, election and law making becomes tension-filled where the rich fear distributional struggle of the poor to satisfy material justice while the poor, with fire in the bellies, fear the coercive potential of law in a condition of structural injustice. This irony can cut the solidarity of national citizenship and unbound them from community obligation where they live. Law, unbound by canon of justice, is amoral. It fails to abolish the effects of privileges in judgment.

Faustian pact obliges the state to provide security and welfare to citizens in return for their loyalty. This is basis of unity of a pluralist society like Nepal. But the capacity of laws to integrate society and polity faces challenges from the atomising tendency of market, competition among the poor for low wages and their inability to create agency for collective action. Nepal's transition from pre-national identity to citizenship added inclusion in the edifice of constitutionalism. Just institutions implicate justice which can provide a basis for just public order.

The constitutional separation of power is based on dark view of human nature which drives politics for self-interest and, therefore, checks are placed to avert the fear of tyranny, make leaders rule-bound and secure individual freedom. But the tradition of paternalism in Nepal has made power separation fluid, eroded the efficiency of public institutions to achieve their tasks and dispense justice consistent with the Constitution and SDGs. Public morality of Nepali leaders demands ethical awareness of their power and choice of good over evil. It is rooted in ethical life which tends to secure ordinary Nepalis from human and nature-induced vulnerability and set coherent objective for ecological, social, economic and political justice enabling the poor to satisfy their needs vital for social mobility.

But Nepali polity must balance social inclusion and meritocratic virtue. The link of laws to scientific evidence and reason is obvious but whether its execution and interpretation is driven by conscience or self-interest of interpreter has an effect on democracy. The use of scientific culture can dispel myth and fatalism but in no way they can fulfil Nepalis' desire for dignity. Nepali leaders, driven by secular traits, needs to embody moral checks and imbibe constitutional spirit on their power lusts.

The supremacy of law in Nepal is often challenged by justice demanding social forces, such as women, Dalits, workers, indigenous, ethnic groups and minorities and entrenched elites whose power impulse favour privileges, impunity and self-righteousness. The constitution cannot be used to justify violence. The crisis of stable political order in Nepal springs from lack of constitutional enlightenment, logical incoherence in the interpretation of laws, basing arguments not on public reason, spirit of constitutionality and universal public morality and structural impediment in recruiting judges.

If law is decided by merit of the case, judicial organ ensures its protection and executive aptly administers law and policies it can lay the groundwork for a liberal adjudication in Nepal. If judges are selected on the basis of partisan prejudice and they have to attend parliamentary probe and hearing the judicial autonomy, integrity, credibility and wisdom suffer. Justice, more than law, is vital to the growth of personality. The practice of constitutionalism is a remedy. It refuses to recognise the power of powerful over the general interest of Nepalis and marks an emancipatory break from popular legal maxim of Nepal "law for the poor, immunity for the rich" for a qualitative change in the nature of rule of law affirming justice.

### Citizen-centric Peace Building

The restless labour of Nepali citizens for positive peace has found its resonance in their peace building activities. But now this trajectory is encircled by unsettled problems. As a result, peace in the nation continues to compete with other endless claims, such as sharing power, capacity building of provinces and local bodies, flexible citizenship, proportional inclusive representation, controlling social vices, fulfilment of basic needs and satisfaction of identity- mania of scores of political and social actors. Negotiation and fixing of these competing claims into a legitimate public order is a precondition to fulfil an ardent desire of Nepali public for respect, esteem and peace.

The signing of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) indicates that Nepal is not remote from the centre of human civilisation. The battle of Nepali leaders and citizens now lies in realising a rational approach to education about it and adjusting their conduct to goal-directedness. The central responsibility of Nepali leadership lies in peace-oriented activities affirming rational human nature, entrenching liberal norms in a highly impulsive politics and balancing the need of Nepali state for national security and societal needs for freedom and self-governance. The reason of Nepali state presumes to protect leaders and groups from their own propensity to commit evil acts and the state of lawless freedom they want to exercise without the justification of good public reason.

Moral awareness
The moral awareness of the government about its own power orients it to practical measures for the creation of a liveable human condition fit for all Nepalis and enables adversaries to seek a common social, political, economic and cultural ground for conflict transformation. Nepali citizens' roles in multi-level elections have been well extolled but their roles in peace building have not been sufficiently discussed either in knowledge building or policy analysis. The slight interest is partly due to the confusion connected with their self-unimportance because of stress on great men politics, partly due to overblown polemics about pacifism and ritual invocation of perfect bliss articulated by spiritual organisations, partly due to their fragmentation into different camp of leaders, mass media, sub-national organisations, civil society and rights-based NGOs which hardly treasure social learning and partly due to more aspiration and less outcome that public discourses of enlightened citizens have generated to the Nepali policy makers overshadowing the role of citizens in building peace.

The notion of peace is bound up with a constitutional order based on mutually agreed principles for the behaviour of all actors in their dealing with each other. In this order, they can defend themselves and pursue their legitimate goals without having recourse to sadistic means of violence incompatible with the goal of peace. Stacking values in binary code such as democracy versus the state, human rights against security responsibilities, professionalism versus partisan alliance, tradition versus modernity, men versus women and one class, caste, ethnic group or race against the other have only unfolded blindness about overlapping interests and, therefore, could not resolve the multidimensional conflicts of Nepal. These antimonies have defied the hope of unified public action for peace. Any attempt to project conflict along this code implies that there are active interests to repress Nepali citizens' scream for the promotion of long-term peace. The conquest of certain inner and intra-party rows in Nepal is vital to evolve civic culture and resolve the condition of unstable power equation.

It is essential to alleviate the fear of government holding either simple majority or two-third majority support from abrupt collapse thus leaving the tasks of governance teeter. This tendency of politics has often opened space for each other to negotiate for absolute gain rather than mutual advantage and put the Constitution in a trap of lawless combat. Nepali citizens are, therefore, less satisfied with mere preaching of the politically correct words by their leaders as they see the surge of battles at all levels of governance leaving the agenda of peace, prosperity and happy life woefully tantalising. They want their leaders improve the moral quality of their life and constructively engage to foster peace norms with the right deed. It can stifle aggressive behaviour overtaking peace building task. Positive peace is the goal of Nepalis' life and, for this, they aim for ethical virtues that avoid political extremes, classical norms of hierarchy, patriarchy and status quo and reconcile free will for social change against the domination of deterministic politics.

Peace building as a practical area involves a set of goals, policies, strategies and programmes which aims to foil the eruption of armed conflict, evades structural and direct violence and seeks to set up a legitimate political frame for all the stakeholders to peacefully participate in ecological, social, economic and political life of the nation. It provides a keyhole for an analysis of the root causes of conflict in Nepal and an examination of the transformation of troublesome links between structural injustice and the cycles of violence and counter-violence setting a downward spiral of security, democratic and development processes. It is possible to establish stakeholders' solutions if each actor of Nepal comes out of its institutional, ideological and personality frames, understands each other's legitimate concern, begins to communicate public purpose, recovers the balance of state-society coherence and offers peace building a remedy for the security of all Nepalis. Rebuilding the state is a precondition to the success of any national initiative-security, order, service delivery, mutual dependence and acculturation to national life.

It has become an imperative for leaders and groups to moderate the lingering habit-driven thinking and keep grievances within the bounds of optimal order donned by Nepali Constitution. Legitimate order means the leadership has to forget about "imperial peace" to resolve internal conflict by inviting external powers and facilitating oneself to rise to power in Kathmandu with their support. The success of decolonisation moves has ended the utility of this approach. Only a few satellite states, under the penumbra of great powers' footsteps, follow this path. Similarly, they should also relinquish the idea of "muscular peace" that resolves conflict by rendering opposition forces to impotence. In a country of diversity like Nepal this sort of peace cannot last long as it fosters structural injustice, opens societal fissures for divide and rule politics and creates various kinds of opposition-both extra-constitutional and anti-systemic.

The "hegemonic peace'' is power equation-based which too did not sustain constitutional stability and foster social, economic and political development in Nepal. In this model, powerful actors impose the rules of the game over the less powerful against their wish and stir up multiple resistances, peaceful protests and rebellion. Peace based on human nature stokes fear of domination and denial of basic needs. It is dubbed as negative peace.

A "democratic peace," based on human reasons and norms, transcends imperial, muscular and hegemonic styles, ensures the citizen's ownership and participation in peace dividends, upholds human rights and social justice and creates the circle of more winners by expanding constitutional and institutional bases of rights, power, resources and recognition. It is a negotiated one and, therefore, citizens, as stakeholders, pin resolute hope in its sustainability and demand transitional justice to conflict victims considering it important to bridge the dichotomy between CPA and its honest execution, help leaders stay truthful to their promises and enable them in general and conflict victims in particular to realise their inalienable rights, dignity and social harmony.

The level of overall progress in the state determines the efficacy of citizens and civil society to spur national aspiration of democratic peace. The public realm of intermediary associations where women, conflict victims, children, youths, Dalits, Aadibais, Janajatis, Madesi and all groups of citizens at the grassroots are engaged in restoring the broken relationship, building enterprises of production, distribution and exchange and rebuilding the general life of Nepali society. They uphold realism of precise conviction, rather than ideologically and emotionally conditioned stance, to weave the web of peace. It is a conviction which remains unwavering even during shifting balance of political power in Nepal. Ordinary Nepalis perceive the sterility of violence as a tool of politics.

Integrated strategy
A correct disposition of Nepali leaders' will can place constitutional checks on power, entice contesting groups to overcome adversarial situation and shape the perfection of shared future. Essentially, peace building by Nepali citizens is rooted in the sense of peace community formation: in the rationality of peace education, mediation of grievances, appreciation of the preservation of human rights, execution of transitional justice and promotion of human values, enterprises and reciprocity that avail basic needs for all and eliminate future sources of illegitimate conflict. An integrated strategy for conflict mitigation, post-conflict reconciliation, peace building and renewal of democratic spirit helps ensure predictable financing for early recovery activities. An economics of peace, undisturbed by any passion and instinct, in Nepal rests on collaborative efforts of entire drivers, actors and stakeholders and their general compassion for improving the human

### Active Citzenship in Democracy

Democratic state demands attentive and free citizens. Regular dialogues on basic values, actors, norms and issues of democracy can politicise Nepali citizens and rears active citizenship that can influence public policy. In this sphere, they can shape political will and preference with co-nationals to attain national vision. Citizenship is the membership of an enclosed political community, the state, governed by legitimate monopoly on power, loyalty to which surpasses loyalty to sub-national identities. Active citizens can assume duty to community, society and the state which is crucial to gain equal security, identity and welfare benefits for good life.

Civic virtues
The Constitution of Nepal has laid down 31 rights for citizens - freedom of speech and organisation, right to work, social justice, social security, education, health, etc. It ensures their representation and participation in governance and fortifies the belonging to the state. It has stipulated four duties - protection of national sovereignty by being loyal to the state, obedience to law, compulsory service needed by the state and safety of public property. The ability of citizens to pay taxes defines their legal and economic status which is a mark of civic duty. If citizens are around their own selfish interest, they end up tearing the web of rights and duties, taking and giving and privileges and charity and pass rational judgment on social contract. Tax-evasion, corruption, illicit capital flight and national betrayal are crimes that make democracy empty, without funds to fulfil citizens' rights. The maker of modern Nepal, P. N. Shah said, "Bribe givers and takers are the enemies of the nation." His universe, united by a common garland, echoes the Nepali national anthem now. Periodic renewal of citizens' active consent through fair elections refills the civic virtues.
The boundary of Nepali state does not correspond to society which is large. Nepali citizens have moral duties to aliens as the nation is a member of many global regimes and bearer of human rights. It offers them the prospect of post-national citizenship and the resolution of antinomies between nationality and humanity. The Constitution stipulates self-perpetuating unitary idea of sovereignty. Nepalis are nationals, not reduced to determinism of provincial and local domains or vicious hatred of the ‘Other'. Their duty lies in creating a national identity out of differences of individual interests, ideologies and biological origins. It creates a shared background for the mitigation of fissures.
Constitutional awareness of Nepalis instils in them with patriotism which is vital to bridge the chasm of loyalty at multi-actor governance even to the global spheres where many citizens earn their living. Hope of progress in Nepal can return if group-differentiated citizenship does not cut the ability of the nation's minorities to fulfil their special needs, become equal citizen, protect their cultural identity and nurse national feeling. Group-differentiated citizenship has the potential to re-tribalise the nation. It is averse to modernity couched in terms of individual and human rights and tramples its moral ethos of respecting outsiders and giving them justice like a post-Westphalian state. The Nepaliness is defined in terms of their stake in the state.
Active citizenship is a condition for a vibrant democracy. Citizenship, as a political character, is linked with the public good. Progress, aided by Nepal's wisdom and way of life, evolved national character and dignified freedom. Democracy has granted rights to get passports to join in the global labour market, some even in unsafe jobs. But it did not build a worldwide public sphere where Nepalis can control decisions though they hugely contribute to national and global economic progress. The participation of ordinary citizens in the internal economic opportunity is waning. Monopoly, syndicate and powerful organisational leadership, less accountable to Nepalis, stymie the national productivity and rescue them for free will. Only monied classes, diaspora and globally mobile elites reap the benefits from the new economy. Globalisation has spurred internal democratic deficits because decisions do not require the "consent of Nepali people" making mockery of popular sovereignty, global ethics and universal human rights culture that marked a transition from the state of nature to civil society, constitutional rule, international law and cosmopolitan ethics. Growth of civic virtues rooted in constitutionalism can enable Nepali citizens to strategise for the future through active learning about tolerant politics and actively participate in rebuilding of the community, society and the state.
Social Learning: Social learning enables one to know that they are citizens of a state, universal humans and species beings and have parallel duties at the level of constitutional state, jus gentium (inter-state law) and cosmopolitan norms and solidarity. Nepal's citizenship rights are rooted in both jus sanguine, hereditary and jus soli, birth origin. Democratic spirit transforms passive Nepalis into active citizens at various spheres. It equips them with cognition, skill, disposition and full maturity, jagrit manushya. Political education opens a new possibility for cooperative action across the nation's populace of 125 caste and ethnic groups, 123 languages and 10 religions each with its own values and interests. It eggs on them to reflect seriously on their living condition, acquire wisdom and repair the ethical capital for societal cohesion.
Better ethical capital means less chance of misuse of inhuman ethnic, class, caste, gender, or tribal determinism. It greases shared norms, values and institutions that make common life of citizenship possible. Active citizenship is governed by personal integrity and responsibility about common good. Praxis of socialisation on public education, works and resolution of collision between public demands and budget deficits enable them to harness and use land, labour, capital, technology and knowledge depending on their relative benefits. Passive citizens are satisfied with their representation in politics while active ones are participants of the polity. In Nepal, increased political awareness, social inclusion, proportional representation and subsidiarity opened new domain of citizen activism. Social and economic citizenship through membership in self-chosen association, union, civil society, cooperative, movement, network and federation in development infrastructures, school management, drinking water, consumer groups, health and sanitation, irrigation, cooperatives, clubs, etc. have increased their civic competence. Nepal's local governance has introduced public hearing in project selection and budget allocation, social audit, information and public consultation making the governance responsive.
Citizen-Driven Politics: Nepal's constitution has reconciled popular and state sovereignty and set their authority over other actors. In this context personalisation and centralisation of authority by leadership is immoral. Leaders need to strengthen the parliament and its committees and a culture of deliberation in the parties, before taking any decision. It can set up democratic procedures. Recent national, provincial and local elections have ignited hope for citizen-driven politics keeping the spirit of democracy alive. It seeks to address the needs of citizens from public security, rule of law, health, education, production, market, voice, etc. and bring the state closer to communities. Citizens' active participation in planning, budgeting, monitoring, evaluation and social mobilisation enables the governance actors to fulfil institutional duties and meet the needs of social justice groups. It brings the private citizens into political sphere and creates an interface between them and the state. Citizen's Charter refers to their rights and duties, aims to improve public service delivery and fosters responsive governance. Nepal has enlarged the domain of women's rights in many areas. The right to grant citizenship in mother's name, effective gender budgeting, appreciation of their family work, zero tolerance to violence, 33 per cent representation of women in parliament, speaker or deputy speaker of the House, president or vice-president and chairman or vice chair of local bodies are important steps to liberate them from patriarchal culture, its discipline and rationalisation.

Innovators
Supply roles of the Nepali polity enable citizens to gain access to public goods. The state receives necessary feedback to sustain democratic dynamic. The new civil society with the feeling of "we" are providing hope for citizens and spurring the need for institutional reforms. Emerging from diverse geographical, social and economic backgrounds, the youth, workers, ordinary citizens, local entrepreneurs and cooperatives are giving support to citizens' needs. These democratic innovators aim to change Nepali politics, economy and society. Without active citizenship, Nepalis will be clientalised to families, lineage groups, friends and leaders. They cannot combat misery and fatalism by transforming passive people into active Nepali citizen. The international community can add by showing relevant experience, financial support, resources, tools and technical skills for citizenship-building beyond instrumental and empirical approach. But the local society must learn to update archaic infrastructure, apply practical standards and ensure that scarce public resources are visibly utilised to contribute to a self-regulating, adaptable and resilient democratic communities to combat natural risks and social vices rejuvenating democratic political culture and harnessing the potential of national economy.

### Media and the Public

Mass media such as print, radio, television and cyberspace are useful mediums to link the word to the world. They elevate life's social bonds and carry out the surveillance functions in society. Three vital tasks of socialisation, integration and adaptation of social and political systems are performed by communications. In an economy, media supply information to ‘invisible hand' seeking a balance of supply and demand and alleviating the scarcity of public goods. The knowledge society and economy rest on circular flow of information like in a cybernetic or human nerve system where receivers and senders are linked by signals, networks and feedbacks. Similarly, autonomous media stir citizens' ability to learn, think, feel, perceive and know turning active observer of what is happening around them. These processes have made Nepali citizens highly alert, critical and active participant in the public life. 

Learning habits of media have spurred a synergy of the social and political structures evolved by citizens themselves to pursue their strategic goals. Learners become the future multiplier of knowledge and skills to propel up policy agenda. This assists them to incise undue influence of interest and lobby groups standing as a spoiler of problem solution. An efficient response to rapid socio-economic, technological and political change and growing competition in today's media landscape in Nepal, entails journalists to become a creative part of history. Historical consciousness of the present helps overcome the national habits of forgetfulness and confront today's challenges. The notion of popular sovereignty embedded in the Constitution of Nepal implies the legislative power of citizens. This makes the public a sacred symbol of journalists on whose name they defend their rhythm of idiom, tone and action. Structural freedom of media is, therefore, essential to stimulate the moral consciousness of their power and engage in public's struggle for a reflective gaze. This spreads media's radar and renews the democratic life mini publics of the nation.
The critical questions Nepali media persons usually confront are: Are Nepalis able to exercise equal sovereignty when national media are unfairly distributed in society and their degree of participation in public affairs is determined by the level of their access, influence and control on socio-economic preconditions of modernity? How can Nepali media establish citizens' constitutional right to know through the diffusion of information and innovation if bulk of them are dominated by party affiliation, business community, the regime and geopolitical interests lacking fairness of judgment on matters of national security, liberty, justice and wellbeing? Do media conform to the norms of public sphere and stomach valid criticism of the public or refuse to slit objective truth from power, interest and ideology?
A sober inquiry is central to know how many Nepali media exercise freedom of conscience and plot credible message to citizens and how many of them interpret truth to what they would like to see. In the case of distorted perception they cannot claim moral authority to judge actors and institutions and prepare citizens for democratic habit. On the contrary, the parasitic growth of media becomes unreflectively sensational. In no way does it greet either the return of ordinary public before the structures, processes and system or set the safe future of posterity. It only diverts public attention from the main issues Nepalis face, fragments the nation's political culture and maintain senseless indifference to public's unfulfilled life.
Nationally embedded media struggle to hold the current drift of Nepali society to many directions and rush to the task of nation building. Cross-cultural communication, diffusion of national heritage and culture and loyalty of citizens are vital means for adaptation of the nation in the whirlwind of new geopolitics. Culture enables to predict the behaviour of others. A generational divide exists in Nepali journalism which isolates ideologues from realists and vernacular from other languages. Another divide is between conformist socialisation by old institutions of family, community and religion that opens an opportunity to the nation's varied public life and modern media culture that isolates one set of audience from the other and obscures the link between media ethics, economics, democracy and sovereignty.
The manifest public duties of media as suppliers of news, views, images and amusement stand compelling. They are supposed to free Nepalis from private prejudice, passivism and fatalism and enlist in the public sphere to discuss common problems. Rational public opinion allows citizens to exercise their power of choice and use scientific reason to dispel blind faith and bias whose malaises insult inner vigilance. Democratic crusade of media can liberate truth from the regime's gadgets seeking conformity and link citizens to universal public.
The great feat of Nepali media lies in educating Nepalis to think sincerely about the state of the nation, free them from structural limits, fill democratic values and endow a rewarding life. This is why C. W. Mills mounts a spirited defense of "sociological imagination" for journalists. It is vital to cultivate deliberative public who can rationally decide the choices for Nepali nation. Research revels electronic media violating code of conduct and backing social passivity Nepalis. Their audiences are receding into the circle of family and friends, not forming an interactive public and shaping democratic will for social change. One must know that a multi-cultural society like Nepal cannot hold together without good media infrastructures and laws that provide access of all citizens to information, ease their communication and build right view without which the ability of regime to govern declines.
Politics turns rational if citizens are informed and guided by a lively public sphere, enlightened opinion and general interest formed through reasoned conservation. An equal, open and free public sphere fosters democratic values and contributes to the democratisation of Nepali society. Media's analytic account of public issues and their remedy justify a search for constant progress of human affairs. But this requires them to set aside high political rhetoric where politicians stir hearts and minds of ignorant crowd without uttering any policy messages. This replaces the role of reason which can hardly become a staple of Nepali history. Media need to spur Nepali public's fight to control their destiny and dignity. But if public opinion is monopolised by the media what is left for elected political leaders is constant alienation of electorates which does not augur well for democratic accountability. The public morality of journalists, therefore, rests on their ethical life and the sanctity of their means and workplace. Morality is, after all, the soul of freedom. It negates elusive consciousness considering it a silent enemy that only intoxicates the audience.
Nepali journalists, as interlocutors of the public, need to probe its problems in every moments of life. Social and political pluralism expects an air of media competition and professionalism where public issues get top priority in agenda setting and framing of news and views to visualise the public. Professionalism does not mean blind passion, loss of human feelings and immune to public criticism. In a troubled nation, like Nepal, context-sensitivity is essential to evoke emotional intelligence, conscience, bridging feeling and innovation beyond linear-logical knowledge of cause-effect. This moving consciousness restores an application of intelligence and imagination in reporting, not provoking, events and issues. It cleaves news from advocacy, velocity of ad and entertainment that depoliticise the public. This is why every public office in Nepal recruits one press officer to inform the public so that citizens do not fall in a trap of disinformation. Transparent communication upholds an enlightenment belief in social progress which is essential for the evolution of self-aware society. Invisibility of the public mirrors the failure of media and loss of their editorial freedom. This pulls Nepalis to a culture of silence. Only a live public sphere generated by what J. Habermas calls, "communicative action," can refill democratic spirit of media in Nepal. This action, for him, is "oriented toward reaching understanding," which marshals vital reason to strengthen Nepali democracy.
The public service value of media prompts journalists to uphold their duty to society. Media express the voice of voiceless, the weaker side of the public, such as women, children, powerless, disabled and marginalised and activate the concept of citizen's equality. They make the governing power lawful, visible and accountable. Without responsible media, politics operates in a void, devoid of substantive issues, creative work and critical inquiry. In a one world of many societies, multi-channel communications also open social fractures. Awareness about these fractures, professional learning needs and methods are, therefore, critical to know the changing pattern of global media culture as it has instant implications for Nepal. An informed public can reform Nepali society and leads to a more civic course. It animates ideals, constructive criticism, activities and collective power of society vital to engage in a compromise and peace.
The hurdle to free communication, as Norbert Wiener says, is created by those allied with "the game of power and money." When fusion of this game serves a mediating factor of citizen's life all the systems and sub-systems created to organise citizens in a national space suffer. Pre-set filter, inattention to social issues and limited their ability to inform affect the integrity of the life of journalists. Unless they are stoutly backed by the web of court, their own solidarity across partisan lines and civil society their profession is consumed by a discord of free will and lack of essentials. Nepali journalists' defence of the public thirst for justice rather than reflecting only the institutional biases of their employer can build the civic competence of citizens enthusing in them a feeling that their thinking and behaviour affects the track of public policy. Public accountability equally calls for a diversity of voices and a rough sense of balance in news. It demands disciplining the powerful interest that controls the access of citizens on public goods and new rule of equity vital for a civic culture.

### Civil Society and Political Parties

Political party is a part of society, not whole like polity and the state. It claims the right to defend certain ideas and interest, represents citizens and fractionalises the society to expand its vote base. Party has emerged in opposition to despotism and politicised citizens to fight for democracy. As an agent of social change, the shared dharma of political party and civil society is to modernise the general society and work for its reform and renewal to make democracy a way of life. Conscious of freedom and autonomy Nepalis can articulate their voice for a fulfilling destiny.

Rationality
Genuine civil societies stand above partisan prejudice for worthy initiatives and build bridges across various empirical social, economic and political divides. But if they emerge from the incubus of parties and geopolitical forces, they stoke social and political cleavages, incarcerate the public sphere and indulge in instrumental actions. For average Nepalis, it increases the cost of politics and stifles the birth of civility and national will. Acute party-mindedness of leaders has turned Nepali parliament feeble to advance public interests. Several verdicts of the Supreme Court against their actions stand as a hostile witness. The names of Nepali parties do not match with their ideologies. Leaders' impulse for durability in power made many compromises and less faithful to their own parties' vision. The rationality of civil society rooted in altruistic human essence seeks to improve leaders' utilitarian instinct.
Genuine civil societies offer democratic impulse to families, communities, societies, political parties, business and bureaucracy for cooperation. They champion satto guna based on enlightenment ethos - freedom, justice, solidarity, ecological ethics and peace. The instinct of political party is rajo guna, a craze for power calculation and animus dominandi, instinct for domination. The virtues of civil society propel them to perform niskam karma (selfless service) while parties are the domain of partisan selfishness. Their fierce competition with rivals for a control of rule, authority and legitimacy flags the purpose of political power what Alexander Solzhenitsyn says, "A call to service." Civil societies bear cultural and cosmological values while political parties shape tools of power. Their domain of action is confined to the state's realm. Political parties are indulged in ideological indoctrination what Karl Marx calls "false consciousness," partisan attachment and political mobilisation forking paths for the left and the right but a common lust for power. They turn wild when power shift in coalition swings the perception of each other. Only leaders of democratic parties maintain a balance between their drive for power, sense of personality and upholding of conscience to act in response to vox populi.
The fundamental questions in building interface between the two are: How can Nepali civil society and political parties mediate the polity and social classes to remove the evils that divide them in sharing constitutional goals? Can both work for participatory culture aiming to eliminate all forms of biases and privileges from public life and public policy and open up possibility for Nepalis to become cultural and creative citizens? Is Nepali society capable of sustaining its history and tradition of tolerance when civic education, interest articulation and communication performed by parties and civil society nourish pre-political style based on biological and social differentiation? When citizens face authoritarian decision-making from family to the halls of power? How can civil society-political party interface contribute to the canon of a just constitutional order which can bring the redeeming power of politics to settle contesting issues? Can Nepali leaders achieve good governance when they have to operate under pre-modern polity devoid of real power separation, autonomy, capacity to implement the constitution and functional specialisation of roles? Ordinary Nepalis' support for transparency, however, is opening actors and institutions to vital reason and inquiry.
Nepal's major political parties – Communist Party of Nepal, Nepali Congress, Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal and Rastriya Janata Party-Nepal, dozens of smaller parties and myriad of civil society operate in multiple directions. Some of them lack constitutional will as they are liberated from the ethical norms of politics. Synergy of party-civil society interface is not enough unless they stand on the reason of state, shape a shared view on democracy, human rights and justice and coordinate their policies for a common future. The stability of Nepali polity rests on institutional equilibrium of power and moral strength of its leaders. Nepali people are citizens of Nepali state, not polity, government and political parties, which entitles them with equal constitutional and human rights.
Constant engagement of both in educating citizens about civic knowledge, life-skills and wealth-creation helps them to realise their potential and perform public duties. An elevation of human condition calls for opportunity in building this nation and bridging the fundamentalist gaps that drown the voice of reason infecting political polarisation. Nepali citizens' claim of state sovereignty can help political parties to contextualise policies and laws and set a common ground for the resolution of symbolic, cultural and distributive conflicts symbolising regression of human values. Habit of oiling legal tradition of politics can stop interventionist mismanagement of statecraft by means of several strategies:
First, civil society as an epithet of reason and feeling and capable of achieving self-awareness, must instil historical awareness among party leaders of Nepal to transmit the authority of polity in society, respond to changing aspirations of citizens and curb the affinity of politics to personal, family, territorial and privileged interests. Social inclusion can fortify the social base of politics and clog extra-constitutional engagement, extra-parliamentary formation of caucus politics, identity-crazy forces, interest and pressure groups, lobby networks and anti-institutional social movements engaged in a vicious battle for micro-narratives and privileges, not real social transformation.
Second, civil society of Nepal needs to widen the old binary frame of friend and enemy politics for a modern politics of mutual action based on constitutional spirit. This cuts the conditioning of politics by caste, class, ethnic, gender, territorial and ideological factors. It subverts democracy's optimal values of national integration opening an avenue for protest politics. Leaders' forage on deliberation, discipline and feedback in the party committees can simply rear personality cult rising from authority distinction than performance and dilutes inner-party democracy.
Third, the historical crisis in Nepal's reformist politics reflects the flaws of parties to uphold a middle path, act as a mediating agency of society and infuse reforms in each generation of citizens for the rational idiom of political life. Civil societies have to assume duty to limit them to the structure of public law, democratise their ties with their auxiliary bodies and citizens and fortify inter-party dialogue for broad-based consensus on issues of public goods. It revitalises the hopes of moderates in politics.
Fourth, political parties and civil society need to collaborate on justice. It is related to the vision of Nepal's constitution and global humanitarian obligations to the poor. Both need to revive old solidarity with the marginalised. Nepal's parties are poorly institutionalised in terms of subsidiarity, autonomy and complexity of functions. Top leaders loath creative ideas and inconsistent in organisational direction but deftly bargain for power with factions. Civil society need to introduce code-based values to make them sensitive to human rights.
Fifth, modern legitimacy stems from the elections of multi-level governance. Nepali leaders need to link the top with the bottom of society to cope with what Aristotle calls "mean state between self-indulgent and being insensible." Coherence between the initial ideals of parties and the justification of current path ease them to keep historical identity and settle fissiparous inclinations. Their natural formation can free both from borrowed life, open debate in the public sphere about the duty of public power and institutions of modernity and embolden leaders to execute the constitution opening path to political stability, prosperity and happy life. The removal of vacuum in security can expedite democracy, development and peace processes. The civic culture imagines a qualitative change in the cognition, values and attitudes of Nepali leaders to inspire a stake of Nepalis in the constitution.
Sixth, decision-making sphere of Nepal entails rational politics to open up leaders' mind to social learning of the changing nature of citizens' rights in order to inspire their orderly civic participation and initiate social and economic reforms. Deeper institutional transformation leaps from alternative vision and leadership provided by grassroots organisations, local bodies and civil society. A real democratisation of Nepal's political parties, however, requires arresting the collective diversion underway from constitutional goals and behaviour and synergising all the connective forces and resources of social capital for a rational construction of future order. Federations of many civil society groups are moderating the hierarchical system of production, appropriation and control through intermediary associations- free cooperatives, small enterprises, self-help and economic institutions as they do not disregard nature and labour's pain.
But the key propellers of modernity such as education, economy, health, technology, institutions and leadership are not yet fully rationalised in Nepal to achieve the integrity of rule of law. In this context, the civil society-party interface requires getting rid of their own self-ironies and enforcing democratic accountability attached to the public expectation of their duties. Protection of the integrity of Nepali politics from pre-rational actors entails the state to create a just public order above power tussle.

Constellation
Democracy is a national system where the state, economy and citizenship find constellation. It is opened to its citizens but maintains certain closure as democracy demands self-rule, immigration control and nationality. Nepali civil society and political parties must acquire ability for self-control and add to the rejuvenation of polity and society. This liberates their tendency to indulge in pre-modern adversarial practices that creates a society of winners and losers. Modern politics of collective action demands Nepali leaders to overcome inner deficiencies, attain the outer constitutional and universal goals of SDGs and enabling the nation to secure public goods, progress and peace.

### In Pursuit of Wellbeing

The bulge of consciousness has widened the concept of wellbeing exposing citizens and leaders to a big picture. Sages, philosophers and scholars have always been engaged in seeking universal values of wellbeing with cluster of themes such as freedom, justice, social esteem, compassion, rights, healthcare, liberation, happiness, social security, economic participation, political opportunities, peace, etc. in a pursuit of decent standards of living. It manifests in different ways around the world upholding various strands of thought and philosophy espousing the wellbeing of citizens under diverse pre-historic and historical traditions. The Vedas say that human beings have an ability to transcend selfishness and attain both humanity and divinity-the higher stage of wellbeing.
Janak, Astavakra, Ved Vyas, Valmiki, Buddha, etc. have set examples of how a great intellectual ferment of wellbeing is secured without coercion. Ancient Nepal espoused four dimensions of human life-dharma (virtuous conduct), artha (wealth), kama (pleasure) and mokchha or nirvana (emancipation) for physical, social, moral and spiritual wellbeing bound up with optimally good life. The last one does not dawn with the resignation to fate, social determinism, envy or ego but by an active and mindful engagement in the public life and removal of all barriers to knowledge, wealth, health, balance and nurturance. True wellbeing comes through enlightenment, innovation and freedom to determine vital choices of life affirming the wisdom of the Upanishad: damayata (self-control), datta (altruism and giving) and dayadhvam (compassion) to those in need of care. These normative compulsions have levelling impulses. It is useful to resolve the inner incongruity of life and ease one's conscience.
The Isha Upanishad issues a wise message," while enjoying the fruits of creation one should not covet for others' possessions. One should partake in the means of livelihood to the minimum and conserve the resources available in the universe for others to meet their requirements." This impels justice across human and natural world spurring the reason to defend what Gautam Buddha and Karl Marx call need-based economy to resolve external incongruity of life. The supreme ethics of science and politics finds its resonance in the ongoing global debate and consensus on sustainable development. Wellbeing is thus linked to outward, material pleasure and inward joy of life linked to pran vital to set off existential life-process.
Wise persons see others like themselves, cultivate creative zeal to gauge wellbeing beyond empirical indicators and measure the quality of life in holistic sense. When human grief vanishes by getting the dignity of life citizens seek to reach the oneness of humanity now somewhat affirmed by the canon of human rights. But it does not fully cherish the cosmic web of life as it is anthropocentric in nature. The will of humanity is governed more by the virtue of duty than rights. In the Nepali context, the prime condition of wellbeing rests on the fulfilment of basic needs, then the attainment of general public goods and finally perfect bliss which can be achieved by higher will affirming the destiny of its civilisation. This perspective demands a control on the wild expression of human nature by legal bounds, inclusive social transformation and common traction on normative and legal issues on the scale of human values that stops the hidden cuffs of cognitive dependence, ends violence in politics, restores ethics in economics and whets the resilience of ecological and social life.
The modern meaning of wellbeing in the nation underpins freedom of Nepalis from the chains of ignorance, basic needs deficits and fear so that they can pursue their rights to live larger lives. It is grounded in the moral and constitutional frame as it helps to confront evils of society for the attainment of freedom, equality, entitlements and adequate social opportunities animating a more enriching way of living lives. The approach to wellbeing is not calculated in the economic system of accounting of growth and habits of material consumption only without the use of democratic ethics. Enlightenment view of human nature considers human as rational being capable of judgment and public action for the prevention of harm and promotion of wellbeing. The contamination of wellbeing in Nepal springs from the unstable condition of self and society generated by the nation's post-traumatic stress disorder and misery of the world that sets political culture clashing with the satisfaction of pent-up needs.
Knowledge of Nepalis about the pain of scarcity is necessary for breaking its causes through duties, accountabilities and justice where the state, citizens and a variety of institutions in-between have to play creative and complementary roles to capture the synergy of progress. An awakening to this helps oneself to acquire power and ability of true self and set the path of wellbeing and self-realisation. The sutto guna, divine virtue of human beings, enables them to become creator of their own destiny and exercise wisdom, not entirely conditioned by tamo (passion) and rajo (spirit and valour) gunas or external compulsion. In a least developed nation like Nepal wealth creation is crucial but not enough to catch the delight of wellbeing. The source of wealth-greed, avarice and undue misuse of nature and poor is simply unsustainable. It creates a biological destiny built in human nature. Such destiny is afflicted by jealously, poverty and insecurity. It hits inner disharmonies and breeds befuddled conviction, profession and law animus to rational consistency with moral high ground.
In the pursuit of wellbeing, the Constitution embodies many social and economic provisions including right to work, education, health, social security and even universal human rights. Ironically about 25 per cent of Nepalis are deprived of the basic necessities of life while about six million youths tormented by the miseries of life are working hard in foreign land to sustain their living and support the national economy. It is important to lift the unfair burden on the life of the poor and re-moralise public life deemed fit for them to belong. Feeding the stomach lifts the heart to long for freedom. Therefore, Nepalis had until recently defined shuva lav, just price as per innate value of things in the market place evoking corporate social responsibility and maintenance of business ethics where civil society can educate about the aim of life.
So long as Nepal continues to practice revenue-based economic model, dream of remittance, tourism, excessive import, aid, investment and careless use of natural and human resources and maintains rich-poor gap, the nation's rise to developing country is hard. Dependence does not sustain the springs of hope for a socialised polity nor nurtures national sovereignty, the collective manifestation of individual freedom. Nepalis must be liberated from the bottom up for creative social initiatives and enterprises so that each of them can explore life's immense possibilities beyond biological survival. The Constitutional vision of right to work supposes a job that pays a liveable wage for everyone. This requires labour market reforms along the line of social development and economic imperatives of ecological balance. It is possible by ending the grubby transitional politics, curbing patronage and shifting politics to democratic affinities- reflection, deliberation, policy making and collective action.
The role of Nepali state lies in promoting the "real economy" to ensure food sovereignty, adaptive skills of its citizens fit for the jobs in technology-driven economy, condition for the realisation of equal rights and duties and enabling them to undertake civic roles. The role of government lies in removing institutional deficiencies by shifting the legal and ethical balance in favour of the ordinary citizens, weak and marginalised while the role of democratic polity lies in widening the public sphere, acquiring capacity to deliver public goods and reaching out to those who no longer have faith in liberal way of life defined by the power of reason for its failure to confront political problems. Wellbeing of Nepalis is relative to their expectation bred by electoral manifestoes of political parties, leaders' promises and constitutional provisions with their ability to pull self and communities together to a higher plane. A person's wellbeing is the result of overall satisfaction with much solidarity with family, community, society, profession, the state to many global networks.
Among the multitude of forces that propel prosperity, knowledge, artificial intelligence, communication, entrepreneurship, connectivity and distributive justice are the vital ones. They empower Nepalis to realise their slumbering potentials, utilise surpluses of the nation, meet challenges and capacitate the state to comply with global obligations. Nothing can stop Nepal from achieving its elevated wellbeing once citizens, imbued with confidence in the power of sovereignty embedded in them and leadership guided by national vision, begin to step forward in a committed way in the implementation of the Constitution and maximisation of welfare provisions entrenched in it. They can change human condition through right decisions in every aspect of life. But they must be cautious enough on who are subverting the polity and allowing the surge of centrifugal geopolitics and clogging the state's outreach at the grassroots.
For Nepalis, wellbeing is more than comfort of existence. It rests on preference compatible with aspirations of what Immanuel Kant says "moral destiny." The decay of religion and ideologies has renewed the principle of utility and contaminated moral atmosphere. But it is restoring human appeal to knowing self that vindicates commonsense and values self-esteem again that sets a reasonable equilibrium between physical, psychological and spiritual state of life vital for animating wellbeing.

### Democratic Dyanmism

Democratic consciousness has inspired the struggle of Nepalis of diverse stripes to turn their rights congruent to public goods. Civil society as their associations, federations, networks and movements aim to guard their interests from the capricious actions of the holders of power and wealth, and spur their creative engagement to make governance open and responsive to public interests. Civic action is the engines of political democratisation and social modernisation from below. It enables Nepalis to build their community vibrant and control the deviation of public policy from constitutional spirit.
By cultivating the general will and public action, duty-based Nepali civil society groups seek to keep democracy in fair balance. Their volunteerism has historically complemented the state functions while collaboration with citizens moderated the utilitarian prejudice of politics and the business. Stirred by the enlightenment values Nepali civil society have served the voice of weak and enriched the bridging social capital of Nepali communities. This turned civic sphere inclusive in discourse, engaging and dynamic so vital for democracy consolidation.
Socialisation of selfish nature of human beings towards civic ideals of tolerance of diversity, education, culture, communication, laws and institutions enables public action in many areas of public good. It can control extremism, dualism and contradictions that heaped various vices in Nepali society - poverty, inequality, discrimination, ecocide, social violence, corruption, impunity, refugees, etc. pounding the writ of democracy. Now Nepalis have developed a habit to compare and judge democratic life of the nation with its constitutional ideals and universal principles, not just relying on dead statistics, legal logic and causal determinants which misjudge the links of bodily needs with mind, spirit and soul. They seek to improve overall human condition reared by historical wisdom.
Robert D. Kaplan says, "Democracy loses meaning if both rulers and ruled cease to be a part of a community tied to a specific territory, the state." This means democracy project of rights-based civil society in Nepal needs to transform Nepalis of various identities into equal citizens able to exercise their 31 constitutional rights and four duties, and remain loyal to the institutions of state. Only their critical debate on democratic values and actors can renew the project of ecological resilience, human rights, democracy, social justice and peace. The interactive forums of Nepali civil society can offer the solution to these irrationalities and bring the society and the state back to the middle path. It enables the leadership to create a condition to secure security, basic needs, civic rights and pluralism. Citizenship is a condition to engage in public sphere and a shift from clan-based, group-enclosed and pre-rational insular community to group-opened, rational and citizenship-based society unbounded by geopolitical interest, partisan politics, interest group, business or cultic leaders caustic of social capital, civic sensibility and democracy which are essential for political stability in Nepal.
The Nepali leaders have yet to align politics, laws and public policies to a common civic spirit and constitutionalise all the actors such as the state, market, political parties, civil society and individuals to steer them to the direction of social development, social justice, environment and human rights. The regime is seeking donors and INGOs to collaborate with national NGOs, civil society, local bodies and communities and align their activities to national priorities. This can bridge the knowledge, skill and resource gaps in the spheres of women, children, livelihood, poverty alleviation, job creation and skill training. The Social Welfare and Development Act provides legal structure for local bodies to register, renew and monitor NGOs and civil society. They can cancel their registration of those indulged in social engineering and divisive politics and spending most of money in administrative cost, not target groups.
Those working at inter-village or municipality level have to do the same at province level. INGOs, the soft power of global regimes, cannot work directly with local NGOs and civil society without the official consent. Nepal offers civic space for civil society and NGOs, chamber, journalists and authorities to participate in Good Governance Committee at the local level. The demands of Nepalis for democratic dividends--social inclusion, rights realisation, skill, education, health, technology, information, market access and development imperative have amplified civic space where civil society can plug in to balance the mounting deficits.
The Nepali state's pluralist social and cultural universe historically tolerated the liberal values. It did not suppress the society's freedom to self-organise, articulate and effect public action. This has provided Nepalis associational life, a culture of autonomy, mutual trust and cooperation with the state on security, protection, wellbeing and freedom of citizens. The evolution of democratic impulses, social inclusion and right-based development broke the social closure for Dalits, women, poor and minority in public life though some political parties still harbor parochial politics of negation, identity craze, politics of difference and the realisation of group-differentiated rights which excludes the other beyond democratic citizenship of equality.
Great Poet Laxmi Prasad Devkota argues that the corruption of public culture followed the propensity of intellectuals and rulers to think for themselves first before the nation and people and minimal interest of well off in social investment. It hit the resilient rebuilding of this nation. One reason is that leaders as a role model under diverse regimes seemed concerned more about the self, family, business and partisan benefits than about public goods where party-affiliated civil society are subjected to grubby conformism while donor-driven to clientalism-both lacking interest in democratic emancipation of Nepalis. The other reason is the real lack of democratic accountability and the vital counterweight of fair media, autonomous civil society and judiciary to limit the bargaining power of interest groups, fulfill primal urge for basic needs and detribalise Nepalis. Democratisation is closely allied with distributive justice. Now, civil society need to build the skills of Nepalis to beat their weakness and enrich civic virtues to create a healthy community linked to one another as a member of common nationality and shared humanity.
Both the government and international community in Nepal find local bodies, community organisations, federations, cooperatives, NGOs and civil society valuable partners for their projects considering that they are less bureaucratic, more flexible, innovative, adaptable and issue-based. They are complementing the development and political functions of the state, providing the resilience to citizens to cope with their needs for justice, identity, reconciliation and reconstruction. It has liberalised the nature of traditional politics from status-bound to social contract, altered the functions of state and transformed Nepali society to post-conventional direction of inclusive, secular, federal, democratic republic. Still, what is taxing is how can they overcome their partisan character, develop autonomy, build coalitions across diverse Nepalis and enable collective action on matters of public good. Civil society groups in Nepal, as partners in democratic progress, are providing useful information to increase public understanding of governance goals, policies and strategies. Their alternative vision, methods and proposals provide useful information for planning, policy, budgeting, management, execution, evaluation and critical review of democratic progress. Their contribution is cherished by laws and plans. The Nepali Constitution has included lots of social rights for the expansion and deepening of democracy. But, its fulfillment needs multi-actor cooperation including those of civil society and business. This helps to control lawless dissent.
Nepali polity prizes the constructive roles of civil society in improving societal acceptability in policy making and outcome in the preparation of plan, Constitution, Post-Earthquake National Reconstruction Plan, peace accord etc. It can limit polarising effects and build coherence and sustainability in different actors' goals, means and strategies to progress. They have helped to create ownership and representation of diverse interests and moderate macro-development policies -- PRSP,SDGs and post-conflict and post-quake reconstruction through stakeholders' consultation (training, workshop, seminars and discussion) and obtaining necessary public feedbacks for the contextualisation of policy.
The mechanism of accountability is set through Public Account Committee, anti-corruption watchdog, Auditor-General, media, policy makers, donors and voters where civil society invoke right to information entailing the openness of democratic governance. Now local elected bodies engage the citizens' representatives from various walks of life in public hearing about plans, policies, priorities, budget allocation and even evaluation. Others busy in social struggles aim to foster equity in the development outcome (gender, caste, region, age, class, ethnicity etc), ecological preservation (sustainable development) at multi-level rule, delivery responsiveness, education about social charter, social audit, public hearing, formation of Citizens' Groups, partnership and consensus building and enabling polity to pilot through democratic ideals.

The task of civil society in rural areas is to scale the institutional incentives to peasants, workers, women Dalits and poor to adopt new skill, technology and entrepreneurship enabling them to adapt to new age of inclusive transformation. Many hands approach is useful to capture the hierarchy and complexity of Nepali society and internally democratise the public and private actors. Local ownership in democratic initiatives is vital to build indigenous capabilities. It provides basic condition for basic liberties and public services that cuts undue dependence on external agencies.

Local civil society groups are engaged in a variety of mediation and peacebuilding roles at multi-track and mobilising Mothers' Groups and now Dispute Settlement Committee seeking to resolve conflicts by ethics of human rights, justice and integrity of democratic life. A vibrant civil society can correct the power of the state, moderate the appetites of government for arbitrary use of power, resource and authority, democratise political parties and temper the ferocity of market forces in the general interest of public goods vital for democratic dynamism.

### Politics of Social Movements

Social, economic and political institutions set the context, norms and incentives for individuals and group behaviour, and enable them to organise action. They also define rules of the game for inclusion and exclusion. The peaceful revolt of the excluded for social justice creates a ground for producing a new reality and marking a transition from personalised politics. For them, the enemy is the past and the solution lies in impersonal aspiration of a collective identity “social,” a concept in which shared language is found for feeling, thinking and action. Democratic structures offer them a chance to negotiate unequal power relationship to improve their condition. The modern social movements arose as citizens found the structures of union, political parties and parliament too bureaucratic, rigid and hierarchic largely numb to their needs, rights and aspirations.

Shared goals
In Nepal, the scream of protests of a multitude of social forces - women, Dalits, Aadibasis, minorities, human rights groups, federations, etc. seek shared goals of entitlements, resource and recognition beyond the politics of left-right divide. The values of modernity and democratic awakening have offered an impetus for a choice of life and rational change of Nepali society, revealing the justification of justice over law. Nepal’s Constitution has integrated participation, social inclusion and proportional representation as normative frame to widen the scope of citizenship. Their political mobilisation has animated rights beyond the bound of formal institutions. It has revitalised the public sphere of civil society and its capacity to activate participatory democracy. Citizens’ struggles for change emerged outside the electoral politics, political leadership and rule.
The spring of Nepal’s social movements against the unjust use of political power, blind faith and deprivation was stoked by critical masses of citizens. They were motivated by a sense of civic duty to improve the quality of life beyond rights-oriented action. The values of liberation, just rule, justice, peace and eco-balance were grounded in the nation’s classical treatises as they justified public action against unjust order. Newer forces of world system have sponsored sectoral rights, infinite exploitation of nature and poor for short-term profit and misused the nation’s empirical diversity, not harnessed its resilience. They have also incubated counter elites to instrumentalise Nepali state’s cultural diversity for endless regime change for the false harmony of atomised life. This has flagged Nepali society’s ability to converse beyond positivism, state’s ability to deliver public security and goods and its elites’ ability to conceptualise policy devoid of alien guide.
The previous vibrant social movements with salvation potential have now become projectised by aid regime rendering them unfree. Their inability to organise solidaristic action has incised both legitimacy and rationality. Transformational leadership, with resolute human spirit, can rescue them from attrition and rekindle seamless web of Nepali society. In Nepal, most of social struggles for change ended in a compromise without unbolting an open moment for native vision but setting a lot of normative values - popular sovereignty, social inclusion, principle of affected and grasp of their contractual rights. Their texture of life rests on unity of action and care for the posterity.
The information revolution is confronting Nepali elites’ political culture. It has problematised national tradition, culture and the state. Globalisation of social movements has flattened the development, democracy and human rights context beyond the state’s bound entailing rethinking on meaning, structure, agency and political power. Most of Nepal’s youth migrate abroad for jobs and cope with the changing labour market condition and laws governing the nature of works. Labour as a spirit of life and politics as a means of collective action can aid each other. The ownership of sources of wealth is governed by political decisions. Creation of a just labour market within Nepal ensures its vaunted opulence while squeezing it compromises the nation’s future. The breeding of multi-classes across both the capital and labour broadened bi-nary code of politics but did not change its transactional political culture. The new citizenship rights can legitimise new form of collective action to change this. Democratic ethos embodied in Nepal’s social movements has captured the spirit of solidarity across multi-actor and multi-space and parallel socialisation, mobilisation, networking and leadership, asserting the decolonisation of common humanity driven by non-lineal social change.
Rejecting dependent development, Nepali citizens defend subidiarity through the pull of local and global solidarity to reform power for re-distributive justice, reduction of poverty and social inequality ending gender and other discriminations. They have politicised them and adopted universal values for the rationalisation of constitution, institutions and practices. But they need reflective knowledge to defy the commodification of social life by media, traditionalisation of work and reduce the risk of being abused against weak Nepali state. Equalisation of actual life condition despite unequal abilities entails the execution of social welfare state. A systemic link exists between the crisis faced by the Nepal’s economy and citizens’ rights for decent jobs, dignity, social protection, education and health. Realisation of their humanity to normative end-freedom is possible if their movements can build the capacity of state and find term to an emotional aspect of citizenship, responding to systemic risks.
Nepali citizens’ ties with the vital life processes, politics, the state and world system are shifting. Politics expanded the scope of labour, work and public sphere and brought the policy issues to the front of governance. Nepali politics cannot address the problems of its multi-classes unless devoid of common interest orientation. Access of citizens in policy making can overcome their self-alienation and justify strategic action built on social contract, mutual adjustment and even subsidy, housing, health care and education for the weak in exchange for their loyalty to the state and their vote in elections. A shift from symbolic to real economy helps Nepalis to reclaim the state to control social vices through the virtue of its welfare benefits.
The steam of many social struggles of Nepal evaporated. Their leaders were ended in a self-parody, virtual oligarch, projectised and rendered partisan. Nepali state’s retreat from the welfare invited the influence of trans-national forces aligned with local economic interests. But they failed to stand above partisan interest and address grassroots movement of people’s representatives for greater influence of local struggles into institutional power for a people-oriented progress. Organic re-links of social struggles can synergise their will and responsibilise them. But they have to include three dimensions - a public, national and care economic ones and their steady politicization.
Politics is a decision making system. Access of Nepali citizens to this system is central to resolve existential problem. The centrality of co-determination of national politics, law and policy through social dialogues is the key to emancipate Nepalis from self-alienation, fear and dearth of basic needs. Social movement actors can advance welfare politics so that its welfare state finds symbiosis in social democracy. Nepal’s social movements have fruitfully forged solidarity across the national borders and achieved reasonable progress in rights, legislation, cultural identify, politicisation of members but they also face social division, inertia, knowledge cringe and lack of inner democracy. Now struggle in Nepal is pivoted on how Nepalis can exercise their sovereignty and stabilise the state along federal-provincial-local axis to address class, caste, gender, ethnic and regional disparity.

Civic competence
Nepali leaders are daily encountering social struggles, some even fed by drivers of geopolitical conflicts. Their unity of action can re-energise the power of citizenship to shape fair society, emotional fulfilment and care economy. Nepalis’ vision of change rests on their civic competence in bottom-up democracy, dignified life and organic solidarity with its supporters. Inter-connection with world system demonstrates that Nepali citizens’ social struggles have to follow the mobility of capital, not just the state and reshape polity according to their priorities. Inter- and intra-movement unity can contribute to substantial reforms in the redistribution of resources, activate citizenship and engage in evoking their power to communicate those interests to public sphere for debate and collective action but they must abide by the functional requirements of Nepali state’s stability.

### Taxation and Governance

Paying reasonable tax to the state is a civic duty of good citizens. They do so in return for the life-saving goods and services they get. Tax through coercion is justified for the robust government’s role in the economy, production and supply of public goods, creation of a fairer society based on equity and justice and control free-riders. The classical ideal of democracy evoked “no taxation without representation.” But the political limit of the government implies that consent of citizens is vital in any policy innovation. It affirms the democratic spirit of the principle of affected. Nepal’s media have now spurred a heated debate on the political implications of raising and expanding visible tax base by three-tiered governments - federal, provincial and local- without prudent planning and ignoring its impacts on the life on of ordinary beings.
Local units are collecting extra revenue to sustain fiscal federalism and finance growing public expenditures. The Constitution of Nepal clearly outlines single taxation system, not the double one and, therefore, spending on good causes need to be streamlined through the setup of Fiscal Commission. Many local representatives, unaware of their tax jurisdiction, seek well defined laws and rules. The Inter-Governmental Financial Management Act has fixed the proportional distribution of revenue and the royalty of natural resources. What is unspecified is which province and local body is entitled to what amount.
The lack of clarity about economic path, due process and rate of tax collection by different layers and same layers in different scales continue to violate tax rules by stealth, bred malaises in the tax system and increased financial costs for doing business. Some kinds of harmonisation and standardisation in the determination of tax and due diligence are essential to balance the stock of revenue and policies of social justice. The taskforce, set up by Finance Ministry, now aims to settle the prevailing tax anomaly. The question is how can Nepali polity which has already maximised the cost of governance with huge size of politicians and bureaucracy fulfil Nepalis expectation of public goods.
Optimal redistribution of the capital income to the poor can provide them incentives to work harder and augment the power of polity and build its capacity to reduce poverty and inequality. Tax, however, distorts incentive if the income of society is low and the nation is economically less unified. To measure capital income is hard if there are double book-keeping of companies and firms and tax and revenue administration is riddled with a number of loopholes and seductive incentives, reflecting poor transparency and law-enforcement. Only accountable governance can create fair opportunity for all citizens and utilise tax for overall progress.
The howls of anguish of Nepali Congress (NC) against new tax regime manifests in its pledge of not imposing tax in NC dominated local bodies. Some Gaonpalikas and municipalities have already decided not to enforce tax on birth, death and marriage registration, migration, necessary services and wage labour of the poor. What is and how much is taxed depends on the ability of citizens. Business community who had earlier rebelled against value-added tax is not cheerful either. It wants to see the proper utilisation of tax money. The federation of Gaonpalikas has advised its members to review the taxation system while non-ruling left parties hit the street defying it and price hike on essential goods favouring radical egalitarianism. Ordinary citizens, haunted by tax increase, feel that it does not match their income level and services they get from the regime. They fear that it will be used for socially undesirable activities such as purchase of luxury goods, high cost vehicles and increment of perk, travel costs and allowances for normal meetings of local authorities.
The share of tax in Nepal’s GDP is about 23 per cent. Strong tax base of the state can give national leadership adequate policy space for the grasp of welfare measures and reduce the level of misery. Money moving from top-down via progressive taxation of wealthy can develop social welfare benefits to Nepalis and finance the wages of low income groups on health, education, income, contributory social security, social protection of vulnerable, unemployed and support the dignity of work and universal measures. By contrast opponents of progressive tax believe that it reduces incentive to increase income and investment and causes capital flight control of which is vital to drive investment in the nation’s productive sectors of economy.
The constitutional right to secure proportional redistribution and equalisation measures through Natural Resource and Fiscal Commission marks the seal of good governance and affirms the belief that proportional taxation of wealth can contribute to the quality of governance in Nepal. The general tendency is that tax avoidance and tax evasion persist among the high income groups especially those engaged in property markets including intellectual property. Taxes imposed on the income of factors of production such as land, labour, capital, technology, etc. increases the cost of production while tax on the consumption of public goods raises the prices where poor can ill afford.
In this sense, introduction of any tax, direct or indirect, must sensibly match with the ability of citizens to pay. The Constitution of Nepal has promised all welfare provisions from the right to work to food sovereignty, expanded more rights to the citizens and made populist promises during the elections. But the fiscal capacity of Nepali state to fulfil them is weak. The nation since 1990s adopted revenue-based, not production oriented economy, infecting food crisis, misery, violent conflict and migration of youth. The rollback of Nepali state cut in public subsidy to agriculture and privatisation of public industries imposed a burden on the poor facing food scarcity and robed the soul of its social democratic constitution. Lowering of corporate tax did not increase either saving for productive investment or broad-based economic growth. The gross domestic saving as percentage of GDP is about 9 per cent. Nepal always faced a conflict between constitutional ideals of justice and usual biases of powerful actors prompted by private profit, privilege and distribution of income at higher ups.
Taxation influences the governance effectiveness in many ways. The first is strong tax base of the nation provides Nepali government a degree of autonomy to engineer the vision, laws, policies, priorities and institutional design. It does not have to depend on external advice, financial resources to execute development projects and run meritocratic administration. The second is large share of finance in the budget from the tax makes the government accountable downward to the citizens. If bulk of revenue comes from remittance or foreign aid which Mike More calls “strategic rents,” it undermines the mandate of the government to serve citizens and would be interested in sending its citizens abroad in the hope of hopping remittance to finance budget and trade deficits, soaring debt and mitigate inflation.
For long, Nepali government did not care about tax for losing popular support and received large non-tax incomes from foreign aid and investment. This broke political leadership fiscally free from taxpaying Nepalis and less receptive to address their problems. Similarly, non-tax unearned money flowing through foreign businessmen, INGOs, NGOs, civil society, private foundations, solidarity support groups, sponsors of social movements and charity-based organisations have provided leadership additional incentives and leverage to work for the expansion of their own political constituencies, patronage and clientalist networks rather than work for the mobilisation of domestic resources for productive use and generate welfare benefits for Nepalis. It bred corruption. Businessmen, easy with tax-loopholes, are successful to thwart progressive tax with the help of bureaucracy, lawyers and political patronage and stifled redistribution which is the central appeal of democratic governance to peddle the prosperity of the poor.
Erosion of Nepali state’ monopoly on power and its ability to create security and business-friendly environment hamstrung to effectively collect revenues. The tax base of Nepali state is inadequate to sustain polity and acquire, utilise and keep power autonomous of either dominant interest groups of society or powerful business lobby and even donors to set a context for sustainable development. This is why Nepal’s political class is weak to build up the political and institutional capacities of the state for effective governance that can manage both demand and supply, formulate and implement development policies, create public order and engage fully in resilient rebuilding of this troubled nation.
In a crisis time, building the financial capacity of Nepali state and its institutions is vital to enable it to perform basic state functions and transcend geopolitical constraints and conditionalities that contest national prerogatives. The liberal economic policy of Nepal permitted self-disclosure of tax admitting the non-interventionist nature of state. But many business houses collude with certain sections of rent-seeking bureaucrats and politicians which has neutralised the action of all branches of governance in favour of tax-emption and choked governance effectiveness in service delivery.
The ability of Nepal state to enforce law and order and foster national integrity system of economic and political institutions rests on the autonomy of Nepali regime from strategic rents, unearned and non-tax revenue. It enhances the responsiveness of governance. How government uses tax money transparently and yields positive outcome of development matters for political legitimacy. It is, however, absurd to think that a government fully dependent on taxation for revenues will be more effective and responsive to citizens’ needs. The system of checks, monitoring and impact assessment are equally essential both for the efficient collection of tax and its proper use in the public and national interest.
Tax reform in Nepal should introduce high rate of value-added tax on luxurious goods and abuse of tax laws. If a government imposes steep taxes coercively without welfare guarantee in return then it can easily spoil state-citizen relations, underpin poor governance and inflict distrust on public institutions and officials. National leadership in Nepal faces some disincentives to tax coercively owing to its tangible political costs manifesting in contradiction, resistance and opposition. It must assess the public mood, foresee political consequence and understand whether new tax regime veers to welfare regime as per the Constitution or converts into an extractive state that enriches few elites at the cost of many. Democracy is a distributive regime, therefore, its leadership should open possibility to consult citizens on what is suitable tax for Nepal. This can minimise Nepal’s perpetual legitimacy crisis, dependence on aid, crisis of trust on governance and turn the nation successful.

### Bridging the Income Gap

As a multi-dimensional concept equality means fair treatment of citizens of diverse distinctions. It reduces the gap between the haves and have-nots that scar the Nepali nation. The rationality of equality springs from the equal values attached to each citizen. Democratic virtues foster nationality and humanity of person which is a good worth of citizenship equality and entitled with same welfare provisions. They are the preconditions for freedom. Equality enhances the scale of economic security, wellbeing and dignity, reconciles with social justice and finds its resonance in the constitution. It sets the rules of the game. The unified application of the Constitution in Nepali society coordinates the conflicting conceptions of good life arising out of geographical, genetic, social, economic and cultural diversity, hierarchy and patriarchy. Equality can be measured by the same set of rules of governance for all Nepalis, equal rights, equal opportunity to improve their life-chances and equal welfare to find a life of liberty and progress.
One key challenge Nepali leaders constantly face is the right to equality of citizens enshrined in the Constitution and the actual condition of inequality. This gap between the rich and the poor in Nepal is widening serving as a cause for aspirational politics open to alienation and instability. As a result, Nepali state is unable to muster authority, execute the constitution and stabilise the polity. The tension between Constitutional aspect of welfare state which aims to alleviate the misery of 30 per cent of population below poverty line earning $ 1.90 per day and poor state of redistributive politics owing to inability of Nepali state to finance all rights of citizens remain. In a hierarchy of social, economic and political advantage for certain groups, only equality of opportunity can glue multitude of Nepali citizens and share in a common life.
The welfare state justifies the redistribution of income from capital to workers on moral ground on the basis of capital’s income where the contribution of labour is no less significant. The improvement in the living standards of Nepalis can come only through broad-based growth of real economy and investment of surplus on the productive sectors. Economic growth alone does not lubricate the gear of human welfare if its fruits are unfairly distributed, powerful gaining the most and the poor receiving only trickle-down. In the context of growth of democratic awareness, deprivation may feed envy prompting them to engage in radical politics. Well-being across Nepali society can be an effective leveller which can contribute to asset creation and muster ability and capacity to participate in multilevel governance. The meaning of equal rights for Nepalis in the Constitution demands knowledge about it and institutional means to realise them. It provides a sense of security, well-being and dignity and a sense of belonging as a member of the national community, the Nepali state. Economy can grow if natural resource, skilled labour, machineries and infrastructures are optimally utilized and society fully supports its entrepreneurship.
Social justice becomes sustainable with economic efficiency. It can reduce the level of inequality and cope with the negative effects of globalisation. Globalisation frees up the market and intensifies competition among its units but creates disadvantages for those people who cannot compete. This cuts the efficacy of citizenship. In Nepal, the contribution of tax to GDP is little over 15 per cent which is deficient to finance self-sufficient state, fulfil citizens’ all rights and raise the living standards of Nepalis. The share of capital to GDP is less than the flow of remittance from the migrant Nepali workers. The annual per capita income of Nepalis stands \$1,000. The minimum wage for worker per month is about \$ 134 but this is inadequate to sustain even a nuclear family. Therefore, the trend of out-bound migration is increasing at a time when post-earthquake resilient rebuilding of this nation needs their active engagement for many years. Annually about 450,000 youth migrate abroad for job and they are source of remittance, entrepreneurship and local economic activities. They contribute 25 per cent to GDP and its benefits are decentralised in all 77 districts. So does its social costs.
Three kinds of inequality pervade Nepali polity - situational inequality, positional inequality and deprivational inequality owing to lack of social, political and economic links. The unjust inequality is awful for economic progress. Democratic politics is designed to reduce the gap in inequality between the empirical facts such as unequal ownership of land and capital and other factors of production that cause misery in Nepali society and adoption of democratic values that is supposed to circulate power, position and wealth across the social classes, gender and generations through a policy embedded in social inclusion, social protection, social security and positive discriminations.
All these concepts embedded in Nepal’s constitution call for redistribution from the rich to the poor to meet basic needs, create appropriate jobs, avert social fractures and allow creative pursuit of life. The Constitution demands citizens’ part of the sacrifice of their liberty for public security and public order. It is crucial to end the transitional politics and create an egalitarian and just society. This means attainment of public good is necessary. It is a good which does not exclude any Nepalis and can be considered a precondition for social peace. Availability of public good demands both formulation and enforcement of sound public policies based on the spirit of constitution and give a fillip to vital sense of common life. Otherwise, the nation will continue to be trapped in a sort of Greek tragedy where decision-makers do not know the iniquitous consequence of their actions.
One critical aspect of public good in Nepal is public education. It fosters upward mobility by enabling citizens to reclaim control of their destiny and shape the future. Education provides vigilance which is about conscious awareness of one’s own living condition and engagement in production and political struggle to improve this. Distribution of intelligence in Nepali society is a must to make its economy competitive and democracy functional. It fosters citizens’ desire to innovate and engage in productive life. For example, skilled workers in agriculture increase productivity, reduce any need to migrate abroad for earning and invest more in children’s education, health and basic amenities.
Nepal now has a huge pool of skilled workers who have working experience from abroad. Many of them have become entrepreneurs and run their own business and industries. Others have gained skill in the use of modern technology and meet the requirement of Nepalis for human capital equality. Investment in human capital maximises equality, improves the quality of living and meets the need of intergenerational reproduction of human resources. But when financial position is a passport to entry in private education, health, safety, communication and law which poor Nepalis can ill-afford it is hard to gain legal and political equality. Equality before law can only open possibility, not actuality. This is why Nepal’s remote and geographically isolated areas face the scarcity of public good such as food, educational and constructional materials, medicine, fertilizers, etc. at a time of amazing growth of private wealth, transport and communication.
Nepal’s constitution makes social inequality and discrimination on the basis of caste, gender, region and religion illegitimate. But the unwritten transcript of society continues which needs social reforms and institutional effectiveness to implement laws and set up the supremacy of law over social, economic and political leaders. The social discrimination owing to caste, gender or class inequality has perverse impact on equality. Nepal’s social inclusion policy has widened the participation of women, Dalits, and other groups of society in labour market, politics, administration and improved their situation. Only effective institutions can sincerely implement social policies and forestall exclusion. They outlast individual members. But their renewal is important as per the tasks assigned to them by law.
This, however, demands Nepali leaders’ political will and commitment. The influence of money on politics has fostered political inequality. Economic equality is a precondition for political equality and civic competence. In Nepal, the proportional representation is dominated by moneyed class, cronyism and interest groups. This bars the inclusion of a large number of micro-minorities and formulate polices to compatible with constitutional spirit. When money becomes a means to peddle influence on politics, authority, law and development policies, low income groups will be trapped in hierarchy and structural injustice and turning their past as a future. They cannot overcome this situation and attain equality in the absence of political solidarity and struggle for equal status.
Building trust among citizens is important to control free-riders, spoilers and predators, who appropriate the resource flow and block the material basis of the egalitarian transformation of Nepali society, economy and polity. For example, gender equality requires transforming the nature of political economy enabling women to gain access to representation, communication, and participation in public sphere, culture, everyday life and recognition of their identity. The debate about democratic equality of Nepali citizens can be initiated and its solution found in the public spheres and public interest, not in selfish promotion of private interests. It can be furnished where government is the solution of the problem of inequality as it has broad-based mandate to take decisions and formulate and implement egalitarian public policies underlined by the spirit of constitution.
One strategy is the use of public funds for reducing inequalities, the other is increasing corporate social responsibilities, still the other is mobilisation of resources, knowledge, skill and technologies of intermediary associations, cooperatives, local government, CBOs, civil society, NGOs and charity-based organizations in alleviating human suffering such as poverty, inequality, joblessness, etc. The golden rule is: elected political leaders who have mandate for change must think outside their partisan interests and work for the general welfare of all citizens.

### Nepal's Geopolitical Mileage

Nepali leaders and citizens have struggled hard for this nation’s survival and adaptation in the neighbourhood and world politics. This built the nation’s capacity for independence resilient. Nepal’s rank as a small state is relative to its mega neighbours - India and China. By global positioning, it is middle sized. Its stability as one of oldest nations of the world gives Nepalis a sense of pride and identity. National identity comprises durability and succession. It combines all local narratives into a national one and transforms the parochial forces into centripetal ones without assimilating them into a melting pot. But, undue disparity within the nation can breed social fractures which can easily be exploited by internal spoilers and external predators. Cultivation of national interests in a situation of free flow of ideas, goods and people that characterise globalisation helps retain social cohesion, economic progress, political stability. Nepal’s new geopolitics needs to back inter-subjective frame, not just geographic determination of politics or winners-take-all market, for a purpose in the national state enough to fill citizens’ lives.
Nepali state is nurtured by both hard power of institutions and soft power of culture, language and identity. They have stitched Nepalis the world over. National authority, defined by the Westphalian state system, has now been contested by a number of state and non-state actors, institutions, forces, processes and human rights values. Those rooted in other societies often favour international jurisdiction to step in if national politics goes awry. The tax base of Nepal is scant to shore up state-centric order and shared idea of justice. Its knowledge, power, resource and legitimacy rest on the support of global community. The incongruity of Nepali state and its population settlement and surge of many regional and global issues require multi-level cooperation.
Technological innovation and road, rail and air connectivity of both neighbours have reduced the distance, cut the old geopolitical barriers and altered the earlier idea of border. This has exalted Nepal from colonially given buffer status into a more dynamic macro milieu reshaping its leaders’ perception about opportunity from the startling outreach of neighbours’ power as global game changers. Their neighbourhood priority hooked Nepal from the periphery to geopolitical focus.
The strategic geography of Nepal makes it vital for neighbours’ security. It has larger border with India which provides opportunity for huge interaction but also makes it vulnerable to the incursion of illegal elements. Its proximity with the Gangetic belt, the heartland of India, open border, Gorkha recruitment in the Indian Army and shared communities add Nepal’s geo-strategic value for its security and stability. The espousal of democracy and modernity for long implied Westernising ambition of Nepali leaders to contain the communism. The realism has rescued geopolitics from ideological grip. As a result, certain clauses of Peace and Friendship Treaty, exchange of letters and Arms Assistance Agreement that brought Nepal under the shadow of common Anglo-Indian security is set to unwind now. The shared worldview of the Indian and the Western powers on regime compatibility and security construct made Nepal sensitive to assert its sovereignty.
The Eminent Persons’ Group has, therefore, identified many debatable issues to settle and reset better ties. Apart from civilisational links, Nepal-India ties are shaped by security cooperation, roads, railroads, sea transit, power plants, air fields, economic development and human enterprises. Now, the growing Sino-Indian cooperation on border security, trade, investment and international relations has opened new geopolitical option for Nepal to ease the handicap of landlockedness. India is improving its image in Nepal, executing development promises and cultivating shared bond.
Likewise, Nepal’s proximity to Tibet, an underbelly of China, where major powers are converged for its separatism makes Nepal no less strategically vital to its security. Nepal can be a conduit for spurring Sino-Indian collaboration if its leaders can build trust with each than they are with each other and resolve their security dilemma. Fierce contest for security suffocates cooperation. But the perception of power gap between India and China entailed Nepali leaders to gravitate toward the latter’s incentives and initiatives on OBOR, Boao Forum for Asia, AIBB, SCO, foreign investment in strategic sectors, Trans-Himalayas Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Networks, adjust policy on regional and international institutions and promote trade and transit diversification. These are blinking in the global eye.
Both neighbours have shared interest to neutralise the soft power of Atlantic nations. They are providing succour to Nepal through their own NGOs without engaging in grassroots activism. China has suggested India to engage in partnership with Nepal avowing the validity of trilateralism. New geopolitics is based on partnership and burden sharing, not hegemonic or dominating. But, Nepali leaders must be aware of the outcome of choice they make in the context of the exhaustion of its institutional strength, fractiousness of leaders and highly remittance, aid, trade and foreign investment-dependent economy.
Diversification of dependence on external world turns Nepal’s choice interdependent which means external resources from the global powers and institutions are needed to sustain internal life. Nepal is attractive spot for global community to host useful activities increasing its acceptability. Banding with the LDCs, mountainous, landlocked and small states has amplified its leverage beyond vicinity. But its leaders’ view is that the geopolitical weight of neighbours is more important than the shifting global alliances, rise of neo-nationalism, crisis in multilateralism, climate change, etc.
It is setting a new milieu for Nepal to veer to Easternisation policy, resorting to a modified realpolitik, not aspirational idealism, viewed by the West a source of dwindling civic space. Prithvi Narayan Shah, like Otto Von Bismarck of Germany, believed in robust welfare state to make citizens happier and loyal. Nepal defined its integrated security, economic, political and cultural policies to shield itself through active defense and ensure citizens’ livelihood for their loyalty. His insights are still relevant today.
Nepal’s affable social bonds are now inflicted by a clash of partisan interests. Internal political consensus is vital to the art of foreign policy efficacy. The nation’s ethical image can grow if institutions of enlightenment become public and leaders draw citizens’ loyalty to the nation, build state’s interface with them to gear up progress and allow both to advance national interests. Neither Nepalisation nor Sanskritisation has dissolved local cultures. Nepali state is the home of minorities in every facet except religion, language and culture which acted as unifying bonds. This is why it took minority as an issue of social justice, not security to be settled by muscular force. Nor minorities demand the right to secede though parochial political parties have reared many centrifugal liberation fronts and identity-based bodies to inflate their patronage despite their huge costs for nation building. Nepal’s cultural pluralism in the past served as unifying factor while politics hit the nation’s fault lines. The identity of Nepalis to native land brings the union of its geography, history and culture. Like France, Nepal fostered civic nationalism, based on shared citizenship, not multiculturalism with differentiated people, which cancels out civic identity and stokes race-oriented politics unravelling the spatial congruence of the state, economy and citizenship.
Rising nationalism marked Nepal’s shift from buffer to sovereignty. It can free its leaders from the snooze and rethink the utility of employing old concepts - semi-colony, sphere of influence, special relationship, equidistance, balancing or non-alignment. In the context of asymmetry of power between Nepal and its neighbours, self-neutralisation limits its freedom which is vital to apply judgment on international affairs. Nepal can attain middle path between certain shared aims and some differences with the neighbours and global regimes if Nepali leaders do not often invite alien forces for regime change to catapult oneself to power and esteem micro-management of nation’s affairs. They need reflection on the nation’s history of sacrifices of its heroes and builders for self-rule and gain aplomb, skill, ability and prudence to clip geopolitical issues stirring its vital interests.
Leaders need to rise up from their partisan frame which has converted Nepalis into a polarised mass to be easily maneuverer by external powers. How Nepali leaders view varied geographic spaces, population and their transactions is vital for policy while national angle can set a rational course. It needs to creatively use conference diplomacy, economic statecraft and adaptive foreign policy behaviour in a multi-speed world.
Nepali leaders need both guts and wisdom to absolve this nation from the Hobbesian Trap and punch geopolitical determinism, a concept which erodes the national freedom of manoeuvre and defies national interest-oriented policy. The harmony of whole gamut of foreign policy issues with any power cuts the liberty to defy, differ and create choice of development partners and make it inapt for national self-determination which has been historically prized by Nepalis.
National freedom ensures right course of action in regional and global politics. The ethical freedom rests on freedom to do good for the nation and uphold: responsibility, intrinsic power and political will to settle vital issues - Lipu Lekh, Susta, immigration, flood and cross-border crime control, removal of export barriers, management of trade deficits, proper utilisation of foreign aid on national priority areas, foreign investment in productive sectors, labour management, utilization of hydropower, balancing ties and fostering international cooperation for win-win game. Enlightened self-interest helps reduce many dependencies such as ideological dependence blunts national conscience, aid dependence weakens the integrity of policy, power dependence restricts legitimacy and blanket import of soft power reduces the source of national identity. New geopolitics can ignite a fresh hope for Nepal worthy to realise its power of place and potential.

### Security Dilemmas of Small States

The state sovereignty of Nepal and Norway as small states largely rests on prudence, reason and skilful exercise of shifting room of manoeuver and apt realpolitik responses to old and emerging security dilemma created by an underlying, unstable multi-polar world. The gush of geopolitics marks the erosion of liberal international norms and the onset of new oligarchic competition for influence among great powers. It is creating a challenging condition for small states to adjust to a fleeting big picture of a new international system. It has also offered choices for their polities, non-states actors, markets and civil society.

Security dilemma
The ascent of China and global aspiration of India mark a tension with the USA if not its allies, on matters of trade and strategic issues of the Asia-Pacific. China and India are also increasingly present in the strategic Arctic Region. The US seeks to engage Nepal in the Indo-Pacific strategy. They demand to support Tibetan refugees’ human rights, support the UN sanctions against North Korea to give up its nuclear ambition, and desist from active engagement in China’s Belt and Road Initiative. This puts Nepal into a security dilemma. The aid incentives US is offering are helpful for cash-strapped Nepal’s economic development, but it cannot prompt Nepal to abandon One China Policy. Nepali citizens feel at ease with China’s connectivity projects and elevated ties with the US. Both the neighbours are calculating its implications to them.
After the Second World War Norway chose to become a member of the NATO Alliance while retaining the pragmatic policy of balanced reassurance and deterrence towards its mighty eastern neighbour (USSR and now Russia). Nepal has since the Rana regime until quite recently, pursued a somewhat circumscribed alliance-free foreign policy, largely skewed toward India and the West, but greatly more balanced ties with India and China. Now, Norway and Nepal as small states face a challenging spectre of old, emerging geopolitical dilemma as the Western liberal order crumbles and their territories attain greater strategic value by competing major powers. They are now challenged to define and refocus on national interests, and less on ideology to escape difficult security dilemmas in an exceedingly complicated world with a retreating hegemonic superpower.
Norway’s High-North has emerged as a dynamic global hotspot for fast environmental change, increasing militarisation and presence of both Arctic rim-states and non-rim states, including a number of Asian states. The latter is arguably a result of geopolitical shifts, responding to environmental, technological and oceanic transportation changes of global scale. The Arctic Council has had an increasingly vital role in inter-state collaboration in the post-Cold War period. It addresses issues of environmental change, polar research and trade, but not hard-core security or military issues. Estimation of the new opportunities and risks as a result of trans-Eurasian integration, rapid environmental change and new rivalry between major powers, characterised by trade wars and escalating high-tech militarisation posing risks for interstate wars is an imperative.
Norway’s Solberg-led neo-con coalition government is currently in its second term. The government has steadily shifted its foreign and defence policies away from the Cold-War era’s balanced reassurance and deterrence policies, in favour of a more one-sided deterrence orientation. Analysts now observe a heavier and more regular military footprint of NATO in the High-North. Norway-US bilateral partnership is another pillar, strikingly under-communicated in national defence plans and by parliamentarians. Both inter-state pillars contribute a remilitarisation of Northern-Norway, notably not with a substantial build of Norway’s own national land and naval forces. The High-North’s military importance is back at Cold War level, but not with that era’s “simple order” of only two rivalling powers.
The US military currently pays for upgrading of the sophisticated Globus-2 Radar at Vardø, a Norwegian island situated right on the enormous, increasingly ice-free Barents Sea. In terms of geographical distance from the capital, Vardø is an outpost located strategically close to the Norwegian-Russian border. Vardø’s income-strapped local government has struggled to cope with a dramatic drop in the population and a surge in senior citizen. Closures of land-based marine processing industries and pessimistic youth migrating south are main causes.
Neither government funds nor a rising nature tourism industry as a birdwatchers’ paradise, create alternative employment of sufficient scale. No wonder Vardø’s politicians remain supportive of foreign presence. The glowingly white mega-antenna, perched on the city mountain, can be mistaken to be a temple-like art installation. Officially, it monitors rubble in space, but this is a clumsy distraction. It takes down and transmits onward extremely detailed satellite imagery of much of the Northern hemisphere. Judging experts and open US military sources, the radar is integrated within the US’s ballistic missile umbrella. Recently, Russia’s fighter jets conducted a full-scale mock attack on the radar, also observed in real time on screens at Norwegian and NATO intelligence quarters.
While the government spokespersons condemned the mock-attack, local reactions were more laidback, revealing Finnmark’s special Second World War history. Hitler Germany applied a scorched earth strategy when retreating from East-Finnmark during momentous months in 1944. The Russians came to Finnmark as liberators. Their valiant military actions solidified friendly Norwegian-Russian relations in a border-region with a region with long-distance east-west trade, migration, cultural exchange and reindeer pastoralism. In terms of cross-border integration, the sub-region can be compared with Mustang’s riveting geopolitical attention. In order to really grapple with what is what is most consequential in terms of a geopolitically framed border politics, be that in Vardø, Mustang or Rauswa, the influential “centre versus periphery” theory of Stein Rokkan, Norway’s doyen of political science is inadequate.
Such striking differences between national politicians and border polities in terms of rhetoric and risk perceptions are not uncommon to Nepal either. Nepal’s lifted ties with the USA and its strategic allies are considered by its decision makers a strategy to reduce neighbourhood determinism and exercise autonomy in foreign policy. There is, however, perceptual gap on both sides. Nepali leaders do not perceive China as a threat to be feared, in the way the US seeks to convince Nepalis. Instead they deem China’s cooperation essential in order to reduce its undue dependence on India, knowing that it is a member of US-led QUAD. Until 1980s, India colluded with the West and Russia against China. Nepal’s improved relations with the US are designed to convince the latter to have its own foreign policy lens on Nepal, rather than see it by the Indian lens. Reducing dependence on India, however, does not undermine shared soft power, open border, Gorkha recruitment and complex ties between Nepal and India. Nepal’s interest to revise the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, transit diversification and good links to the outside world are based on its efforts to open menu of choice.
The growing Sino-India economic ties on many areas have made Nepal’s strategic geography vital for the USA. Nepal may adopt cooperative policy in the Indo-Pacific region without riling the neighbours and accept the USA and China’s cooperation in high politics of state security. But it will detest low politics of backing partisan or demographic interests that radicalizes the identity of otherness within the nation and flags the base of national security.
Neither India, nor China, not even Russia has any interest to defend democracy in Nepal, the shared political ideal of many Atlantic nations. For reason of its own national interest, Nepal will not return Tibetan refugees to China violating their human rights, but considers One-China Policy like India. It has committed not to harbour anti-China activities on its soil either through the use of intrinsic or acquired power. Nepalis believe that Sino-US competition in Nepal has constrained India to operate strategically in the sphere of assertive bilateralism and moderated its appetite for regime-changing behaviour. Nepal appreciates the US and China’s support to conquer its state’s weakness to create national security, stability and authority. The EU, the US and China have shown interest in building the capacity of Nepali Army, supply equipment and expressed readiness to help the proposed Defense University. The US-Nepal cooperation might not be about satellites and high-tech land-based installations as in the High-North. Yet military cooperation is pursued and complemented by civilian cooperation of geopolitical importance.
Despite the background condition of anarchy, international system mirrors global norms, values and laws and overlapping interests among nation-states. Small states, like Nepal and Norway, will not be free from the security dilemma as they find incongruity between domestic order created by the state authority and bigger systemic uncertainty in the world with countless inclinations of various actors entailing them to make security somewhat sacrosanct. Security dilemma imagines that the rise of new powers has generated perceived insecurity to relatively declining USA prompting it to adopt counter measures such as containment, adjustment and new alliance formation.

National interest
Historical memory of national insecurity is the factor behind the formulation of Nepal’s new security policy, which aims to resolve security dilemma through rule-based system. But National Security Council needs a team of interdisciplinary experts so that the state-bearing institutions can identify the sources of threats, provide early warning and engage in mitigating them either through justice, law and order or coercion and widen the state’s outreach in society. Communication to the public long-term national interests such as national security, stability, wellbeing, national identity and sovereign status is vital. This, like Norway, helps build trust among the state, citizens and experts and bridges the gap between state sovereignty and human security. For Nepal and Norway, the optimum strategy to resolve security dilemma depends on resorting to diversification, international law, organisation, deterrence, self-help or building a modicum of trust among the rival powers so that their peace and security are not endangered.

### Politics of Foreign Aid

Dev Raj Dahal

Politics of foreign aid is a powerful economic statecraft of global politics. Nepali citizens are socialised to believe that survival imperative and legitimacy of leaders rest on how much foreign aid they bring to the nation. Foreign aid covers various goals and activities and responds to public expectations. But it also reflects political influence in the public life from family planning, education, health, culture to governance. Foreign aid will continue to lead its development discourse if power elites succumb to aid-addictive mentality and behaviour. Economic crisis, fall of certain donors, rise of nationalism in aid giving countries and newer alliance patterns have led to the sinking of grant and ascent of loan. Nepal needs to reorder its priority in the use of state funds beyond free market solution of the individual and societal problems.  

Foreign aid marks a transition from the patron-client web in the colonial days, economic “take-off” in the cold war, transformation of economy, polity and society in the post-cold war years to crisis management and sustainable development now.  Donors - bilateral, multilateral and INGOs and their allies NGOs and civil society – define priorities in Nepal and shift aid conditions, setting its strategic, political and development tone. Those complaints to donors’ ideological, strategic, commercial and humanitarian interests collect copious aid under paternal protection. Those in the shadow of great powers collect trickle-down. Ideally, aid emerges from the ethical obligation of the rich countries to help the poor to acquire self-dignity. Strings-free aid wires its sovereignty, not flag by external powers’ policy goal. Yet, any talk on aid in Nepal evokes the images of “weariness” owing to a constant lack of desired progress, “pervasiveness” in all sectors of society and “permanence” of aid thus failing to lift domestic capital, technology and skills. It has frequently introduced new paradigm of development.

The cold war ethics of liberal aid sought to foil socialism by exalting state institutions. Socialist nations aimed to free Nepal from reliance on liberal order while others favoured self-help. Secluded long by high mountain chains in the north and dense malarial forests in the south, Nepal was suddenly vaulted into a global strategic game. It drew a stream of aid from irreconcilable worlds, executed class-mediating liberal ideals and adopted economic nationalism, import-substitution, export promotion, neutrality, regionalism and active role in conference diplomacy. The fall of socialism erased the cold war virtues of aiding the state and marked the age of human rights, democracy, market economy, civil society and gender equality. Foreign aid has stabilised the elites’ survival as labour classes are stratified into multi-colour stripes. Aid’s public awareness strategy, however, questioned the performance of polity and detonated political movements of critical mass aiming to reorder elites. The discontent with official aid due to its bureaucratic-political control over the citizens’ lives widened the space for NGOs, civil society and citizens’ groups. The liberal donors gave off bulk of their funds through these sub-elites’ networks having outreach to the grassroots.

Their rivals fostered state sovereignty though multi-track actions. During the post-cold war phase, market sagacity of official aid did not function as Nepal’s economic forces created partisan market of monopoly, cartel and syndicate strutting Nepal into a capricious future. Donors’ support to partisan non-state actors also flagged the performance of local, provincial and federal state prompting the global community to review the utility of aid. The alignment of aid to rights-based discourse, national ownership, citizens’ participation, transparency, accountability, equity and Nepal Development Forum are the outcome of the realisation of inseparability of human values in aid policy. But it scarcely satisfied the restless aspiration of Nepalis for public goods. The aid flow mustered a general consensus of donors and Nepali polity on social development, ecological protection, human rights, democracy, governance and peace. Proper use of aid can build internal capacity to spur surplus to cover balance of payment deficits and reduce foreign exchange and domestic savings gaps. New geopolitics of aid offers Nepal a choice in a poly-centric global order driven by science, transport and connectivity, not geography or ideology determinism.

The realism of foreign aid lies in strategic, political, economic and commercial interests of donors. Sometimes they are mixed with humanitarian ideals of easing the suffering of citizens and saving the lives of innocent from premature death. It has also contributed to mutually beneficial progress, such as adaptation to climate change, protection of global common, management of existential risks, etc. Nepal’s aid practices have experienced many development notions presuming economic growth. Yet, the financial and technical aid which is meant to be its engine suffered from the assault of left and right critics refusing to admit its positive outcome. Left critics view that foreign aid smacks of charity and enhances the power of global capitalism, and its strategic ally comprador class, the enemy of nation’s industrialisation. Right critics claim that foreign aid helps to expand bureaucracy, enlarges the state’s authority and, therefore, creates obstacles to market economy and individual freedoms.  

Bureaucratisation of aid has cut its ability to renew creative social institutions. In Nepal, the “pervasiveness” of aid reveals the loss of confidence of leaders and citizens in native knowledge, skill and resource owing to their uncritical habits to take external policy advice, power and legitimacy regardless of their utility. Nepal faces a gap between aid promises of donors and their supply. Similarly, skewed aid does not tally Nepal’s aid requirements to resolve state weakness and market failures in meeting basic needs and renewing hope. Aid needs to assess the source of economic paralysis of the nation whether it is rooted in the security and political disharmony, corruption, abuse of resources, mismanagement, or bundle of political, legal, institutional and administrative flaws, contributing to a lack of desired progress. If deficits of political security and civil order are the primary problems, balance of payment support will hardly set Nepal in a sound progress curve. Specially, chronic dependency of Nepal has cut its haggling craft for the mobilisation of aid in the national interests and strap up domestic resources for rebuilding the nation.

If the effectiveness of foreign aid in Nepal is judged by its ability to expand high productive capacity to satisfy basic needs, there is a pause. The Development Cooperation Report of Finance Ministry unveils that donors have spent most of their money in Province 1 and Province 3 where human development index is relatively better. The backward Province 4 got the least. This means aid did not follow the criteria of human development index nor geographic distribution. Aid allocation has become elite-centric while the burden of debt for each citizen is Rs 24,276 which is equally shared. Nepal’s foreign debt stands at Rs 436.6 billion while domestic debt is Rs 394.6 billion, unsettled account of government offices is Rs. 120 billion. The flaws of foreign aid can be corrected if elites do not lose integrity of public life, do its need assessment and remain clear about policies, aims and strategies in aid negotiations. It is helpful to know what works and what does not and internalize feedbacks into the aid policy. In the link between knowledge-based advanced society and old Nepali state, foreign aid can serve a mediating platform for mutual learning, not imposing the ideologies, institutions and values of dominant culture.

The extreme reliance of Nepalis on aid working along cross-cutting interests, sometimes centrifugal, makes them its victim beyond the coordinating ability of Finance and Foreign Ministries and Social Welfare Council. If market is regarded as the prime motor of progress and functions of aid underlie filling gaps - saving, investment and foreign exchange- , it is bound to nosh general deficiency, institutional weakness and democratic deficits. Empowering Nepali state and society can spur their equal integration in the global market and reap benefits cutting the density of grievances.  Nepal faces huge migration of youth, brain drain and capital flight while real foreign direct investment is stunted. The choice of Nepali policy makers is neither de-linking from the self-regulating international system nor radicalism, but reforms which provide it option for economic diplomacy.

 Foreign aid in Nepal’s external opening can provide better choice  if  it does not lack vigour in fulfilling social needs, diversification owing to small size, initial stage of industrialisation and dependent on imports, investment, remittance, grants, loans, export of primary products, tourism, etc. The question is how the priority of Nepal’s progress be built on common agenda of aid coordination and controlling duplication and inefficiencies. Aid priorities should focus on domestic resource mobilisation, inclusive economic growth, building knowledge relevant to policy on education and skills, health, institutional framework of regional cooperation and overcoming powerlessness of Nepalis. Beating the flaws of aid is vital to achieve its goals in the mutual interests and validate its “permanence.” A search for new ways in which foreign aid can be utilised in a productive manner, set new objectives, methodology and programmes for partners of development is underway.

At a time when foreign aid in Nepal continues to become a tuneful music to elites for the secret of their political success, it is right time to make it citizen-centric, ecological sensitive, non-commercial and non-strategic. To free Nepal from the trap of vicious cycle of poverty, debt and conflict grant components should get precedence. But international redistribution of public goods demands equal justice at home. The genesis of aid emerged as altruistic motive but suffered from general “weariness” inflicted by bribery, commission, leakage or capital flight abroad incubating a class of elites which thrives on aid and dies with the drying up of aid oxygen. Appropriate outlay of aid in the nation’s priority areas is vital to have symbiotic ties between state and citizens where democracy can mediate the state’s need for civic order and delivery of public goods and citizens’ conscious impulse for freedom, education and dignity. Tied aid for the one-sided adjustment of Nepal to neoliberal economy appears to be based on military model of homogenisation. It exercises disturbing power over citizens causing political decay. If the reality of conditionalised aid produces democratic recession, Nepal should think about de-conditionalisation. Nepalis cherish the values of freedom which is the linchpin of democracy, human rights, justice and peace. Mutual determination of aid spawns positive outcome for functional necessity of Nepali democracy’s chance of survival.

### 2072 BS: An Annus Horribilis

The year 2072 BS was an annus horribilis for the Nepalese people. It started with devastation that came in the form of nature- and human-induced disasters. Humans are helpless to tame the fury of nature but can demonstrate a sense of esprit de corps in the time of utter crisis and tragedy. This collective sentiment and cooperation was once again reified in the Nepali society when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake jolted it to the point of apocalypse in the second week of Baishakh (mid-April) last year, killing over 9,000 people and injuring many more. The tremor did not only convulse the Nepali geography but it also exposed political inertia and indecision. The key political actors were shackled to their entrenched positions, and the quake whipped them into effecting the 16-point deal that helped gain spurts in the constitution writing. The elected Constituent Assembly (CA), considered to be the most inclusive and democratic in South Asia, finally delivered the new constitution, defying the diktats and blusters of the southern neighbour. The new national charter turned 2072 into an annus mirabilis for the Nepalese living with the trauma of a high magnitude.

Light in the tunnel

The new statute was a beam of light into the dark tunnel of prolonged transition. The statute promulgation marked the prideful moment and assertion of national sovereignty. To our dismay, the southern neighbour saw red over its contents after the major parties spurned its hegemonic desire to take the ownership of the constitution. Pinched and infuriated, India came with a vengeance - it imposed an inhuman blockade on the Nepalese, who were still struggling to pick up the pieces following the massive destruction of lives, property and infrastructure. Agitating Madhesi parties brazenly collaborated with the Indian regime to intensify their border-centric protest only to rub salt into the wounds of the Nepalese. The illegitimate embargo triggered humanitarian crisis and caused colossal damage to the country’s economy. One economist estimated that the blockade caused a loss of Rs 2,300 billion and pushed the country 50 years back.

It was the third Indian blockade against Nepal. India has taken the wicked punitive measure against the Himalayan nation whenever the latter dared to defend its territorial integrity and political sovereignty. However, it has been hoisted by its own petard. The Indian government made an embarrassing retreat in the face of dogged perseverance and surging nationalism of Nepalese, and international isolation. It imposed the blockade unofficially and lifted it without formal announcement. Despite this, Indian PM Narendra Modi has thrown the Nepalese for a loop. When push came to shove, Modi is flexing its diplomatic muscle to desecrate Nepal’s constitution in the international forums on the trot. This David-Goliath tussle goes on until the truth prevails over blatant lies, rumours and propaganda.

What saved Nepal from collapsing when it was clobbered hard by the earthquake and blockade? It was perhaps the self-generated power of resilience rooted in the enlightened and altruistic tradition of Nepali civilisation. Resilience is the natural capacity of individual, community, society and the state to pull through from the adverse situation. Political scientist Dev Raj Dahal offers insights into the sources of resilience the Nepalese have showed in extremes. He writes: “Nepal’s earliest history of enlightenment inherited from classical treatises written during Vedic, Janak, and Buddhist eras, syncretic culture, Nepali language serving as lingua franca, heritage of tolerance of diversity, overlapping values, cosmopolitan attitude to asylum-seekers and history of independence infused the virtues of resilience.” The temblor hit 14 districts hard but it spurred the cohesive elements of society across the country, transcending narrow interest and identity. This is a reason why the micro-minority communities of non-affected areas such as Kamalaris, Shikhs, Telis, Tharus, Muslims and Buddhists commiserated with the quake victims and provided relief to them. This altruistic feeling did not only knock the political parochialism sideways but also bore testimony to the fact that when political leadership wimps out, the community rises to the challenge.  

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli ascended to power hard on the heels of earthquake and blockade. His political odyssey from a Naxalite juvenile to executive head of government sounds a bit apocryphal and is full of exciting adventures. Only six months into office, Oli as a premier has not only added a feather to his cap but he has also set a shining example of patriotism for the nation. He unwaveringly stuck up for independence, dignity and right to self-determination. He stood up to the haughty hegemon and refused to give in. For all his shortcomings - his inability to accelerate the reconstruction campaign, and control the black-marketing and runaway inflation - Oli stands tall in the crowd of political mediocres.

Bizarre posture

His courage and conviction impels us to compare him with another charismatic democratic leader, BP Koirala, who had dealt with the giants of Asia - chairman Mao and Jawaharlal Nehru - with great sangfroid. BP never buckled under when Mao pressed him to accept the division of Sagarmatha (Mt Everest) between the two countries.  BP insisted that entire Sagarmatha belongs to Nepal and said there was no question of splitting its sovereignty. Nehru had once asked BP about the agenda of his visit to China when the latter was in India in his capacity of Prime Minister. BP took umbrage at the uncalled for curiosity of Nehru and laid it on the line - ‘it is our internal affairs. India does not need to poke its nose into this matter.’ But, to our chagrin, BP’s party - the Nepali Congress - is shying away from calling a spade a spade. It was afraid of using the term ‘blockade’ for the disruption of supplies during the cruel embargo. It ratted on the gentleman agreement with CPN-UML, throwing their robust partnership into disarray. In its latest bizarre posture, the mealy-mouthed NC was reluctant to criticise the EU-India joint statement that denigrated Nepal’s democratic constitution. The resentful divorce between the NC and UML remained one of the nastier political episodes of 2072 BS. This has put the task of statute implementation in quandary. Much of the country’s political course will largely be set by amity or enmity between these two big parties.

### Public Service in Asia
The Asian identity mirrors a rainbow civilisation, both with respect to its internal diversity and cultural particularity. It is, therefore, difficult to weave different sets of identifications of Asians into a common regional awareness and set policy coherence. The common pattern of similarity in Asia is its political culture. Despite the sign of various modes of governance - traditional, democratic, praetorian and authoritarian - cultural attitudes play a key role in shaping institutions and human conduct. Hindu, Buddhist, Confucian, Islamic and Christian civilisations shape this attitude and give primacy on group interests over ideas of individual rights.
Much of philanthropic giving finds roots in religious feeling of compassion. Pre-religious Vedic scriptures of South Asia elaborate four different types of human conduct: bad conduct hurts others; normal conduct is meant to regulate personal and family lives; virtuous conduct aims to help others, such as establishing resting places, inns, schools, hospitals, well, water spouts and uplifting the poor; and supreme conduct governs Yagna, protecting the earth, heavens and the cosmos for tranquility and peace.
It is binding for the adherents of Islam to give 2.5 per cent of their net yearly earning to religious and social institutions called Zakat (alms), which is distributed to the needy. Buddhism seeks to stop the root of violence within every individual so that better relations with family, neighbours, community and states can be built. Stable peace requires developing compassion and giving support to the needy thamtaan. In both Hindu-Buddhist traditions, property obliges the people to perform paropakar, charity work and social service. Confucian thought, like those of Hindus, confers respect to authority, morality, unity and a sense of duty to serve people within the familial, social and political institutions. The highest ethical standard of Confucian tenet is jen. It means affective concern for the well-being of humanity. Confucianism, like Buddhism, is pacifist and attaches value to the notion of datong, implying that the whole world is one big family, akin to the ancient Hindu wisdom—Basudaiba Kuttumbakam.
The current Chinese leadership feels that Confucianism can fill its spiritual void and compete against Western individualism and consumerism for the creation a harmonious society. The defence of Easternisation containing certain Asian values is a defensive response to a one-sided Westernisation. The base of state-society harmony is precisely the familial values of mutual help which has cut the autonomous organisation of civil society. In Eastern Asia officials monopolise the public realm allowing people liberty to chase self-interests in the private sphere. The Christian practice is better institutionalised in charity. Every devout Christian is obliged to give 10 per cent of his or her income to the Church which is spent on public welfare. The Confucian doctrine and the family-oriented Hindu-Buddhist values oblige people to help relatives in crisis times.
Asian businesspersons value the morals of these traditions and assume corporate social responsibility by establishing trusts, charity society and foundations to fund relief projects and social initiatives. These non-profit associations have contributed to the development of specific laws, regulations and several codes of conduct to govern their lives, fulfil diverse needs of citizens and strengthen civil society’s engagement in social responsibilities. Despite the persistence of high religions embedded within the institutions often lending legitimacy to state authority and in the religious practices of everyday life of citizens, even in the modernising countries like Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia capitalism is pervading every sphere of life and rapidly individualising citizens eroding the muscle of society for public action.
All over Asia exchange ties determine power and authority. Even in modern states leaders arbitrate the use of rules so that interpersonal relations can run easily, unhindered by laws. This has limped the growth of strong institutions. Those who occupy the state authorities and served by them remain satisfied with weak institutions and fear the depersonalised laws, institutions and processes. And when leaders fail to perform duties citizens replace the leaders, not changing the rules of the game and institutions. It is the strength of personal and professional ties that enable the growth of social capital and moderation of conflict. The general Asian family values make the social change process elite-driven, trickle-down and incremental overlapping tradition and modernity.
On the one hand citizens are loyal to authority, order and hierarchy and on the other hand there is fast erosion of this culture thus marking a paradigm shift from ritualised, clan-based, rural and customary traditional society to detribalised, de-ruralised, class-based, urban and modern society required by rapidly changing economic fundamentals, rationality and political modernisation. This shift has been propelled by information, education and science, growth of modern industrial hubs and cities and globalisation. As a result, one can see a new public sphere in the making entrenched in the democratic processes. A basic tension exists between consensus and conflict in the operation of Asian politics. Educated citizens are mobile, skilled and cosmopolitan and exercise more choices in public life. The globalisation is exposing the Asian public not only into each other’s culture but also to world cultures. Enlightened leaders have, therefore, a general willingness to accommodate sub-groups in a common bond of the state.
Many of the Asian leaders’ style can be characterised by patrimonialism. Highly personalised leadership coexists with impersonal laws and political institutions bearing the legacy of the traditional polity in which government is personalised and public administration is the extension of the ruler’s patronage. Powerful leader controls the political economy and the personal ties increasing people’s personal fortune. It implies a lack of strong social discipline—where cultural norms allow the flouting of rules and laws and indulging in corruption--thus a culture of impunity indicating the problem in the institutionalisation of political parties.
The social and cultural context shapes the performance of political institutions. The competition over institutions among various groups is more about power sharing than reshaping lawful institutions. In the weak states of Asia a fatal gap exists in the political order. Decay of democratic institutions mirrors public apathy in politics ripping cross-cutting bonds of solidarity across political institutions with new forms of identity, ideological, ethnic, regional and communal conflicts and even eroding the civility of society. One area of progress is the filling of gender gap in public life. Here, the works of civil society have proved vital in the transformation of politics based on freedom, gender equality, identity and social justice and release modern politics from primitive clutches.
In Asia, the tradition of public service differs from one society to another depending on the level of modernisation and reconciliation between traditional and modern ways to adopt the aspirations of diverse peoples. The Asian style democracy represents personality cult, communitarian culture, patronage and valorisation of the state. In the well-off states like Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore, a basic harmony exists between the capacity of civil society to create public interests and the ability of states to fulfil them. In poorer parts, political institutions are far behind in social, economic and technological change and political promises of leaders outstrip the state’s capacity to deliver, inflicting an atrophy of polity.
In South Asia, argumentative culture upholds a pluralistic worldviews animating civic life despite gross inequality. As culture shapes political development, Asian leaders, confronted with the task of setting up modern states, respond to this by shaping patrimonial forms of power that please their deep mental longing for security, stability and status. This may seem authoritarian but it is a natural response to people’s needs. It ensures community solidarity, group loyalties and public service. Asia’s accelerating transformation may breed new version of civic culture to avoid class conflict, if not geopolitical.
The modernity’s wave enabled the Asian leaders to set up the centrality of bureaucracy, dominant party system and traditional politics. Now, its erosion now gave the birth to coalition politics where diverse interests are represented in the polity offering the mobility of class, caste and gender. Old Asian texts treasure precious ideas for protecting civilised life, liberty and identity beyond social contract. They offer liberal thought on learning, leadership, virtue, just and unjust wars, civility, nobility and common good. In urban nodes the birth of civic coalitions seeks to prevent the fading egalitarian culture while their rural counterparts detest clintalistic nature of winner-takes all political economy.
The East Asian style of trust building is typified by informal, leader-centric and non-interfering in other’s affairs. Religions also played a role in it. The Buddhist concept of Sangha and Hindu’s Sat Sanga played their role in incubating social capital like the art of association defended by Tocqueville. Each civilisation has produced a distinctive pattern of ties between the state and society and tied people’s compliance to order, authority and discipline. In some regions secular nationalism is still the dominant force at the elite level. In others, religious and ethno-nationalism as well as tribal instinct are challenging the state’s writ.

The denial of democratic rights to sub-groups of society has forced them to resort to distributional, identity and rights-based struggle as a reaction to the imposition of Western model of state in multi-cultural societies. Persistence of weak mediating structures in society framed in the image of golden mean involving the satisfaction of basic needs, individual freedom in thought, speech and action, decentralised society, avoidance of a complete separation of the sacred and secular in ordinary life and articulation of sustainable progress explain this. This golden means is vital in every sphere of life to establish the condition of middle ground between liberalism and relativism, globalism and localism and cosmopolitan citizenship and nationalism.

### Leader Transformation

Every society is divided by a class of few leaders and great mass of supporters. As a universal phenomenon, leadership emerges from the social, economic and political conditions, electoral process and institutions of society such as family, tribe, community, political parties and the nation-state. Their ties to these units underlie the scale of vision and responsibility. Since their institutional boundaries are porous, leaders’ action can be judged from their ability to fulfil people’s needs, rights and concerns. Emerged from the chrysalis of new values of freedom, justice and dignity of people, the new political leadership of Nepal has achieved success in launching revolutions but appeared weak in governance.


Like medical doctors, they need to diagnose the changing condition, organise resources and offer policy prescriptions. Their quality rests on how well they manage legitimate demands of people, solve their problems and tread the nation along constitutional path. The antinomy between what Nepali leaders have promised to achieve “happy people, prosperous Nepal, good governance and political stability“ under normative ethics and rival utilitarian paths they have chosen to attain these goals set them in litmus test.

 

Traits

One may frankly inform leadership virtues in terms of transactional and transformational fervour. The bond of transactional leaders to their followers is like business. It is based on exchange-vote buying and rent-seeking, not embedded in the social interest of the nation.  Nepal’s elections have shown the predominance of these Janus-faced demagogues. In a transitional politics like Nepal’s where constitution, values, institutions and procedures of governance are not properly stabilised such a leadership, often plagued by their own uncertainties, cannot address the changing aspirations of Nepali citizens. They have allowed national institutions deteriorate rendering many of them partisan unable to perform optimally and neutrally. Institutional erosion has caused volatility of Nepali political system whose robustness is vital for the citizens to realise their rights, duties, choice and action and affirm the life of dignity. The goodness of Nepali leaders’ virtues does not transpire when national education is reduced to “facts” devoid of values of public morality.

The relationship nourishing, not the task-oriented, nature of most of transactional Nepali leaders have turned the human rights struggle of people unfinished. Their views are insular, self-seeking and sub-culture oriented. Critical masses of civil society often question their authority and legitimacy and cast doubt on their sullen ability to match deeds and actions. Nepal’s electoral trends show that electorates have always defeated the incumbent leaders indicating the need for changing policy contents, political leadership and party structures though they are resilient to bounce back in the centre of politics through networks, organisation control and geopolitical leverage. As a result, Nepali citizens judge their leaders in terms of output performance than only on the basis of glitzy promises. Nepal does not lack the root of wisdom. Leaders need to fortify stable links with the people to learn how to gain wisdom, freedom and dignity.

The transformational leadership is goal-oriented, rationalist in attitude, enlightened and adaptable to both liberal eloquence of the Age and changing aspiration of Nepali people catalysed by democratic revolution. They create a climate of opinion to justify their future roles rather than either discrediting history or harking back on its nostalgia. Their attachment with the people provides a hope even for the poor to engage in transformational project and improve life-choices. In Nepal, one can see transformation in the context, language of discourse, actors, issues and rules of the game but the creation of a just human community promised in the constitution remains alluring. Most of Nepali political leaders are boxed in their own partial frame unable to read other’s motives and intentions and seem weak to inspire the opponents for collective action to help Nepalis relish democratic dividends. 

 Nepali leaders can be placed in the scale of statesmanship, political leadership and bossism. The statesman is a visionary and thinks ahead of his time. He makes his constituency the entire Nepali state and learns from historical insights and scientific trends to reconcile his own ambition with national interests. Statesman’s perspective is long-term perfection of generation and his action matches with the experience of people. He judges how best public and national interests can be served.  One can cite the examples of Nepal’s heroes and builders who defended national sovereignty bequeathing great deeds to posterity.

Political leaders’ vision is rooted in periodic elections and an exigency to flex party’s muscle. They are ahistorical, reactive and thrive on seductive ideological rhetoric and short-term planning. They work with consultants on deterministic theory of progress which is contrary to pluralistic Nepali society’s stability. The cultic honouring of top leadership with 120 kilos of garland during field visit marks the denial of constitutional spirit of popular sovereignty and the start of creeping authoritarianism. The political bosses do not hold any vision, represent only the faction of a political party or electoral constituency, survival-oriented and suffer from historical amnesia. In a word, they are timid on pursuing national initiatives and torn between lust for personal power and institutional imbalance.

Leaders who use national sentiment only for the purpose of personal rise collapse easily when their policies hit the ground realities. The nation’s nonstop political instability explains this.   Nepali nationalism presupposes national awareness of history, culture and needs of people which are a source of political stability. But an awareness of only political party, social units and particular territory twists social cohesion and external adaptation. 

The ideological teeter-totter of the left and the right being projected in Nepal is a fatal sign given the nation’s strategic geography where so many experimental projects of foreign countries are executed. Nepal’s neighbours, haunted by the security dilemma, are closely watching with unease their costs as they see their links with local forces, persons, groups and institutions bristling with the revisionist interpretation of national history. For years, the nation’s foreign policy became prisoner of internal wrangling and lost an art of balance in the age of anger.  A divorce from the historically defined policy of golden mean can easily unravel the tangled aspirations of otherwise united Nepali people into centrifugal pulls risking the fragile social order and peace inciting other countries to limit its policy choices.

 Nepal does not have sound think tanks to supply to the leaders knowledge, policy inputs and strategies to take right decisions on vital issues. As a result, national policy often deviated from the constitutional spirit and public opinion. Many of them are disciplinary-bound and consultancy-based, not policy-oriented, with contextual knowledge and feeling of human heart and conscience to those working under adverse condition. The political parties’ catch-all tendency has made Nepali leaders schizophrenic. They are torn between socialization of political life in the partisan framework and role occupancy to foster national interests, between sacrifice in justice-oriented stir in the past and current intoxication with power and between opposing ideologies and leaders’ coherence in a regime of power-sharing. Evidently, Nepali leaders’ political life is personal, empirical and partisan, not impersonal, national and analytical which are desired to transform themselves from bosses, political leaders to statesmanship and apply wisdom to statecraft. A value-sharing civic culture of leadership can form a common background condition to glue the enormity of gaps between public interest and public policy.

 

Selection

The utility of politics is decided by social interest. Statesman embodies the will of the nation and defends the constitutional doctrine that they have a responsibility to protect and advance the interest of the whole nation and people, not just the fragmented parties and uncompetitive polity.  Leadership selection is about the representation and determination of policy for national development but wisdom is essential for the inspiration of people which comes from the synthesis of knowledge, morality and experience in governance. Enlightened leaders in command of authority can seek compliance to their policies, inspire skeptics and opponents, bear duty and keenly confront the implication of their choices for public welfare.
