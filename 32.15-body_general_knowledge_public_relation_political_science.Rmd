## Public policy

Public policy is the process by which governments translate their political vision into programmes and actions to deliver outcomes.

In his book 'Advanced Introduction to Public Policy', B. Guy Peters defines public policy as "the set of activities that governments engage in for the purpose of changing their economy and society", effectively saying that public policy is legislation brought in with the aim of benefiting or impacting the electorate in some way.

Author B. Dente in his book 'Understanding Policy Decisions' explains public policy as "a set of actions that affect the solution of a policy problem, i.e. a dissatisfaction regarding a certain need, demand or opportunity for public intervention. Its quality is measured by the capacity to create public value."

Public policy focuses on the decisions that create the outputs of a political system, such as transport policies, the management of a public health service, the administration of a system schooling and the organization of a defence force.

Rational choice theory, or now more frequently known as evidence-based policy, argues that focusing on scientific evidence, instead of history and culture, should guide our public policy making.

\begin{questions}

\question What is good governance ?

\begin{solution}

There are various definitions of the term \textit{good governance}. These definitions are based on normative assumptions about how decisions should be made within organizations and the functioning of formal and informal structures for implementing such decisions. The UN Commission on Human Rights identifies transparency, responsibility, accountability, participation, and responsiveness as key attributes of good governance. By linking good governance specifically to human rights and sustainable development, the UN explicitly recognizes that governance issues are global in nature and consequently require more nuanced and integrated approach. 

The Canadian International Development Agency defines good governance as "the exercise of ower by an organization (or government) in an effective, equitable, honest, transparent, and accountable way". This approach to governance focuses on how organizations are directed, controlled and shown to be acting responsibly.

UNDP defined good governance as: Good governance is (the striving for) rule of law, transparency, responsiveness, participation, equity, effectiveness and efficiency, accountability and strategic vision in the exercise of policical, economic and administrative authority.

The UNDP (1997) articulates eight principles of good governance. These principles are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Equality of participation in decision making.} All people, irrespect ve of sex, class, or race should be heard and allowed to participate in deliberations that affect them directly or indirectly. In democratic societies, citizens can participate in various ways, ranging from voting to involvement in acts of civil disobedience. In many instances, participation must be informed and organized through civil society actors who can often leverage resources more successfully. Good governance implies that organizations encourage participation from those who may both benefit or be harmed by any decisions taken. Participation also means that individuals have the rights of freedom of association and expression, and to participate in organized civil society without fear of retribution or the stigma of being labeled unfairly as a "special interest" group.
\item \textbf{Organizations must be responsive to the needs of all stakeholders in a reasonable timeframe.} On one level, this means that organizations must hire, train, and retain employees to achieve optimal response time and high quality outcomes. On a more general level, organizations must ensure that they have the capacity, and in some cases the autonomy, to implement changes to structure and management systems to maximize efficiency.
\item \textbf{Organizations must mediate differences between stakeholders to reach a broad consensus.} Good governance requires that organizations involved in divisive issues like abortion, stem-cell research, human cloning, euthanasisa, etc. enter such debates in the spirit of cooperation and mediation. To achieve this goal, organizations must treat all stakeholders consistently and fairly.
\item \textbf{Organizations must be accountable to the stakeholders they serve.} Good governance requires a broad definition of who such stakeholders may be. Many organizations limit intentionally the list of those they define as valid stakeholders to narrow the scope of decision-making authority, the range of topics addressed, and the nature of the decisions that are made. In general, organizations should be accountable to those affected by the entire range of decisions or actions made and implemented by an organization.
\item \textbf{Organizations must strive for transparency in their decision-making processes so that interested parties can understand the bases of decisions and monitor progress.} Good governance requires that organizations justify decisions made by demonstrating how such decisions respect the precedent from previous decisions.
\item \textbf{Organizations must work within legal frameworks that are crafted in fair ways, enforced impartially, and attuned to human rights issues.} Good governance means that a countryâ€™s legal environment should be conducive to development. Investors must feel comfortable that due process will be followed in all countries of interest, and that a wide range of issues including protection of intellectual property, fair application of trade subsidies and sanctions, and a regulated financial marketplace exist. Organizations must also follow the laws of the land and ensure that all decisions made are consistent with such laws.
\item \textbf{Decisionmakers should have a broad and long-term vision on how to better the processes of governance to ensure continued economic and social development.}
\item \textbf{Good governance involves guaranteeing the rights of all individuals to maintain and improve their well-being in an equitable and inclusive manner.} This principle conveys the message that good governance is about stewardship and care and that it involves the highest ethical positioning possible.
\end{enumerate}

Clearly, good governance is more political than technical in nature and emphisizes the primacy of equality and the value of vision, strategic thinking, and planning. Good governance is a tool for making organizations work more effectively in a world where trust is declining in government, industry, science, and other institutions. Good governance is based on democratic values that stimulate administrative reforms that affect a range of organizations.

The World Bank has compiled a list of six dimensions of public-sector governance that are used in an aggregate fashion to measure the quality of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption. As new global standards of governance emerge, indicators like these can be used to diagnose failures and to suggest solutions to a range of performance and process issues.

Good governance is an ideal that is difficult to achieve. Although it is essential for ensuring national prosperity by increasing acccountability, reliability, and predictability of decision making in governments, corportations, and non-governmental organization. To ensure that good governance prevails, elected representatives, corporative executives and boards of directors, professional bodies, and civil society groups need to become more active in learning about the perils associated with "bad" governance (social inequality, development failures, and corporate scandals) and push for stronger laws and policies that protect the public interest.

Founding concept of good governance for Nepal began with the description of \textit{Ram Rajya}, meaning the ideal state. Vedic norms and values of Nepal were guided by this philosophy. As a model figure in statemanship, Ram, an ancient king of south asia, is famous in eastern society. He is well known for sacrificing his much loved wife addressing the public. Governance comprises the mechanisms, processes and institutions through which all the stakeholders, viz., the state, private sector, civil society and citizens articulate their interests.

Following series of events can be identified to have institutionalized the issue of good governance in Nepal:

\begin{itemize}
\item Before 1950s the developing countries' governments oversaw as their major responsibility the task of promoting peace and security and tax collection. After the second world war the focus shifted on the development management. Likewise, the developed countries showed interest in supporting lesser developed ones.
\item Developed countries offered support indifferenty of the aidee country's diversity and the receiver country could not execute planned development programmes due to variety of socio-economic problems.
\item During 1980 it was acknowledged that donor countries should alter their policies regarding development aid while the receiver country should strieve to resolve socio-economic hurdles.
\item For the purpose of maximum utilization of foreign aid, donor countries prepared an Aid Agenda which included good governance as a criteria for granting the support.
\item It was first defined by World Bank in 1989 which broadened the meaning of governance by incorporating the role and interconnection of three different actors: Government (state actors and institutions), Civil Society (civil alliances and non-governmental organizations) and Private Sector (households and companies).
\item 
\end{itemize}

However, not a single political party, regime or movement has been able to quash the contributing factors of bad governance. For the last six decades, Nepal has become the zenith of corruption that is leading Nepal toward a failed state. Many types of corruption are prevailing in Nepal that range from petty corruption, grand corruption, legal, moral and political corruption to organized crimes, which have become one of the impeding formidable forces in ensuring good governance. In Nepal, bureaucracy or public sectors have suffered most from the rampant corruption. In fiscal year 2015/16, Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) Nepal received a total of 15,126 cases of corruption.  Furthermore, according to corruption perception index, Nepal ranks 131st out of 175 countries in the world. From 2004 to 2016, Nepalâ€™s average rank on corruption index has been 133 out of 175 countries.

\question What is the role of cooperative sector in economic development of Nepal ?

\begin{solution}

Cooperatives were initially established for raising income generating activities of group of peoples of common interest. Individuals organize into a cooperative voluntarily, cooperate for common good, and are righful to the benefits that arise.

\end{solution}

\question What are the current facilities and remunerations in place for public service personnels ?

\begin{solution}

The facilities and remunerations that public service employees receive are the benefits they are authorized to for dedicating their labor, skill and time in providing service on behalf of government. The reward-facilities may be monetary or non-monetary. The civil service act, 2049 and civil service regulations, 2050 provisions following reward and facilities to the employees:

Monetary reward-facilities

\begin{itemize}
\item Monthly salaray and allowance
\item Grade facilites (increment of salary) after serving for a year
\item Payed holiday service
\item Facility of retirement benefits upon phasing out of service
\item In event of heart, kidney and cancer diseases there is provision additional 5 lakhs support
\item Life insurance of upto 1 lakhs
\item Every year 1 month salary amount will be offered as festival benefit to working personnels
\item Retired personnels will receive a retirement benefit amount of 1 month in addition to regural amount every year as festival benefit
\item Saving of salary (10 percente) as provident fund and additional amount equal to the salaray fraction will be paid by government
\item Provision of payment for health treatment -- equalling 12 month salary for gazatted officer, 18 month and 21 months salary for non-gazatted personnels and personnels without level specification, respectively.
\item Two third of the increased salary will be available in retirement pension, in every raise in salary.
\item Family pension or retirement fund payment
\item Family will be granted Rs 150,000 in case the personnel dies while in service
\item For death of civic service personnel member in a family, child care allowance of 5000 for a child each (for 2 children) will be provided.
\item Monetary award in civil service day to awardees.
\item Allowance for uniform and dress
\item Educational fund, family fund and disabled personnel fund facilities
\end{itemize}

Non-monetary reward-facilities

\begin{itemize}
\item Relocation transfer every 2 years, alternating between rural and urban centres
\item If both husband and wife are employed on the same service they will be attempted for transfer to a common district
\item Non-gazatted personnels will most likely be transferred to nearest localities to their home.
\item Leaves of different kinds
\item For foreign residing ambassadors and personnels employed in consular offices, at most 5 years of unpaid leave will be provisioned
\item Employee service protection, service contract protection and employee protection related provisions
\item For advocating professional rights of personnels, freedom for alignment in trade union
\item For punishing a personnel on beaureucratic basis, provison of refarral to the public service commission.
\end{itemize}

\end{solution}

\question What are the recommendations for making public service more attractive in Nepal ?

\begin{solution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Update basic pay and salary features to reflect contemporary status
\item Develop "pay for performance" indicator and implement in all offices
\item Provision special facilities for personnels working in rural areas
\item Update allowance offerings on dressing and uniform
\item Construction of integrated residence facilities for personnels
\item Automate transfer and promotion system in order to make it more transparent and predictive
\item In order to provision personnels filing up vacant positions in public sector, employee recruitment system should be more responsive and expedient, possibly arraning for twice a year recruitment.
\item Improve workplace environment and render it free of unncessasry interferes.
\item Identification and punishment of wrongdoers amongs the recruited personnels in order to improve public image of the service.
\item Upgradation of public service act and regulations to reflect contemporary needs to make service modern and public friendly.
\end{itemize}

Finally, It should be acknowledged that public service personnels are the carriers of social change. Therefore the sector should be strengthened, efficient and progressive. For this to happen several fiancial, including monetory and non-monetory, amendments should be made. Recruitment process should be streamlined and moderninzed to allow easy entrance of competent individuals. It should be ensured that the personnels are efficiently mobilized. Only then, the public service sector can manifest its full potential. This develops both the service sector and its employees and improves the productivity of the service.

\end{solution}

\question What is devolution ?

\begin{solution}

Devolution is defined as the transfer of power from higher to lower units of any system. In its broad form devolution resembles decentralization, but is often regarded as being more complete and permanent than decentralization. Most frequently, devolution is used with reference to the transfer of responsibilities and authority from central to subnational (or regional to local) levels of government. The World Bank distinguishes between deconcentration, delegation, and devolution as three distinct modes of administrative decentralization of the redistribution of authority, responsibility, and financial resources for providing public services. The three types are differntiated according to the degree of transfer, with decentralization being the weakest form and delegation coming next. 

Hence, devolution is regarded as the strongest mode of decentralization in the sense that powers are devolved to political entities with a separate corporate status, such as local or regional governments. That is why devolution is also referred to as political decentralization. 

Motivations for devolution in that sense include the perception that devolved governments are best placed to develop and implement policies that exploit endogenous local or regional capabilities and are, hence, an appropriate reaction to increased competition between regions in a globalized economy.

To qualify as a devolved system, the subnational levels of government should be legally established as institutions that exercise power within clearly recognizable geographical boundaries. Other criteria include democratic institutions such as popular elections and the existents of assemblies.

\question What is E-governance ?

\begin{solution}

E-governance (electronic government) refers to the impact of information and communication technologies, particularly the Internet, on the values, processes, and outcomes of public bureaucracies.

Government-to-government interactions are concerned with the use of technologies to enhance the internal efficiency of public bureaucracies, through, for example, the automation of routine tasks and the rapid sharing of information between departments and agencies. Government-to-business interactions typically involve the use of the Internet to reduce the costs to government of buying and selling goods and services from firms. Government-to-citizen interactions involve using the Internet to provide public services and transactions online, and to improve the design and delivery of services by incorporating rapid electronic feedback mechanisms, such as instant polls, Web surveys, and e-mail.

Use of information and communication technology (ICT) in government first expanded during the 1950s and 1960s, the heyday of ideas of scientific administration. However, e-government as it is most commonly understood today emerged as an agenda for general reform of the public sectors of liberal democratic political systems during the early 1990s. U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration led the way with the 1993 National Performance Review of the federal bureaucracy.

The 2018 E-Government Development Index places Nepal in the 117th position among 193 countries. Although Nepal is said to be the first country to bring 3G in the south Asian region, it is still at crawling stage with regard to expansion compared to the rapid progress made by other asian countries.

The ubiquity of computer networks offers the potential to increase political participation and reshape the state into an open, interactive, network form, as an alternative to both traditional, hierarchical, bureaucratic organizations and more recent, marketlike forms of service delivery based on the contracting out of public-sector activities (usually termed the new public management). Government becomes a learning organization, able to respond to the needs of citizens, who are in turn able to influence public bureaucracies by rapid, aggregative feedback mecha- nisms such as e-mail, online discussion forums, and interactive Web sites.

Alternatively, e-government does not necessarily require greater public involvement in shaping how services are delivered, but instead, indirectly benefits citizens through the efficiency gains and cost savings produced by the reduction of internal organizational friction, chiefly via the automation of routine tasks. It joins and coordinates the activities of previously disparate government departments and services.

The critics of e-government suggest that changes are limited to a managerial agenda of service delivery more consistent with the new public management and that the opportunities offered by the Internet for invigorating democracy and citizenship might be missed.

\textbf{Status of e-Governance in Nepal}

e-Governance in Nepal has steadily evolved from computerization of Government Departments to initiatives that encapsulate the finer points of Governance, such as citizen centricity, service orientation and transparency. Lessons from previous e-Governance initiatives have played an important role in shaping the progressive e-Governance strategy of the country. Due cognizance has been taken of the notion that to speed up e-Governance implementation across the various arms of Government at National and Local levels, a programme approach needs to be adopted, guided by common vision and strategy. This approach has the potential of enabling huge savings in costs through sharing of core and support infrastructure, enabling interoperability through standards, and of presenting a seamless view of Government to citizens.

e-Governance Master Plan (e-GMP) takes a holistic view of e-Governance initiatives across the country, integrating them into a collective vision, a shared cause. Around this idea, a massive countrywide infrastructure reaching down to the remotest of villages is evolving, and large-scale digitization of records is taking place to enable easy, reliable access over the internet. The ultimate objective is to bring public services closer home to citizens, as articulated in the Vision Statement of eGMP.

"Make all Government services accessible to the common man in his locality, through common service delivery outlets, and ensure efficiency, transparency, and reliability of such services at affordable costs to realise the basic needs of the common man"

In an effort to improve e-governance, there are following institutional and policy arrangements in place in Nepal:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Department of Infromation Technology (DoIT)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Established in 2013, under ministry of communication and information technology.
  \item Focuses on implementing e-governance and covers IT related laws and policies, Banepa IT park.
  \end{itemize}
\item Nepal IT center: Also working as GIDC of government agencies, with DR site in Hetauda
\item Controller of Certification (OCC): Formed to authorize to legalize digital signatures
\item National IT coordination council: Formed under chairmanship of Prime minister
\item Electronic transaction act, 2006
\item e-Governance master plan (eGMP), 2007
\item ICT Development Project (2008-2014). The project promised of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rural e-community (wireless broadband, tele-centers)
\item Government network (GIDC, Groupware)
\item eGov Application (GEA, NID, PSC recruitment MS, Land record MS, VRS and Driving licence)
\item HR development (Awareness, training)
\end{itemize}
\item IT policy, 2067 (2010)
\item 10 year master plan (2011): initiated by NTA taking into account telecom acts
\item iCT in education master plan, 2013-17
\item IT Umbrella Act, 2014
\item National IT Roadmap (2015)
\item eGMP-2 (2015)
\item Broadband policy, 2071
\item ICT policy, 2072
\end{enumerate}

Despite its immense potential in achieving sustainable growth, objectivity and improved governance, and responsive service delivery, Nepal has been lagging to eliminate information poverty and keep pace with global digital revolution. Only 21 percent of the total population of Nepal has access to the internet. Digital transformation demands involvement of diverse stakeholders to meet specific socio-economic priorities.

\end{solution}

\question What is civil society ? Mention its role in good governance ?

In Nepal, the term civil society (Nagarik Samaj) has become very popular and hit the popular psyche with a comprehensive magnitude. Not only non-governmental organisations but even private and business organisation and corporate bodies often tend to claim themselves as being a part of the civil society.

It includes the entire range of organised groups and institutions. These institutions should be independent of the state. They should be voluntary, and at least to some extent self-generating and self-reliant. These, of course, include not only non-governmental organisations but also independent mass media, think tanks, universities, and social and religious groups.

Pluralism, diversity

In fact, to be part of the civil society, groups must meet some other conditions as well. In a democracy, civil society groups should have respect for the law, for the rights of individuals, and for the rights of other groups to express their interests and opinions.  In fact, the word "civil" implies tolerance and the accommodation of pluralism and diversity.

An important prerequisite for civil society groups is that they must keep and preserve their autonomy and independence of the state and private sector.

The first and most basic role of the civil society is to limit and control the power of the state. Of course, any democracy needs a well-functioning and authoritative state. Civil society actors should watch how state officials use their powers. They should raise public concern about any abuse of power. They should lobby for access to information, including freedom of information laws, and rules and institutions to control corruption.            

This constitutes a second important function of civil society:  to expose the corrupt conduct of public officials and lobby for good governance reforms. Even where anti-corruption laws and bodies exist, they cannot function effectively without the active support and participation of civil society. In this regard, the role of civil society organisations in Nepal has been very poor and lukewarm.

Moreover, civil society should help to promote political participation. NGOs can do this by educating people about their rights and obligations as democratic citizens, and encouraging them to listen to election campaigns and vote in elections. NGOs can also help develop citizens' skills to work with one another to solve common problems, to debate public issues and express their views.

Moreover,  civil society organisations can help to develop the  values of democratic life. The values of democratic life are tolerance, moderation, compromise and respect for opposing points of view. Without this deeper culture of accommodation, democracy cannot be stable. These values cannot simply be taught; they must also be experienced through practice.

The civil society can also help to develop programmes for democratic civic education in the schools as well. In Nepal, as we are at a very crucial stage of implementing the new  federal constitution, we need to inculcate the values of tolerance and accommodation in the citizens. The civil society organisations can be tapped for this very purpose.

What can be said is that the  civil society is an arena for the expression of diverse interests, and one role for civil society organisations is to lobby for the needs and concerns of their members, as women, students, farmers, environmentalists, trade unionists, lawyers, doctors and so on. NGOs and interest groups can present their views to the parliament and local governments by contacting individual members and testifying before parliamentary committees. They can also establish a dialogue with relevant government ministries and agencies to lobby for their interests and concerns.

Civil society is not simply to be in tension with the state. Just because civil society is independent of the state doesn't mean that it must always criticise and oppose the state. In fact, by making the state at all levels more accountable, responsive, inclusive, effective - and hence more legitimate - a vigorous civil society strengthens citizens' respect for the state and promotes their positive engagement with it.

A democratic state cannot be stable unless it is effective and legitimate, and has the respect and support of its citizens.  Civil society is a check, a monitor, but also a vital partner in the quest for this kind of positive relationship between a democratic state and its citizens.

The  civil society can strengthen democracy and provide new forms of interest and solidarity that cut across old forms of tribal, linguistic, religious and other identity ties. Democracy cannot be stable if people only associate with others of the same religion or identity. When people of different religions and ethnic identities come together on the basis of their common interests as women, artists, doctors, students, workers, farmers, lawyers, human rights activists and environmentalists, civic life becomes richer, more complex and more tolerant.

Parochial interests

However, in Nepal, the real danger lies in the fact that the political parties have promoted primordial identities so intensely that the ethnic groups have started to keep focus on their narrower and parochial interests. This will hurt the process of democracy building and state reorganisation in line with the provisions of the Constitution of Nepal.

\question What is civil society ? What are the role of civil society in democratic practices ?

\begin{solution}

Civil society can be understood as the "third sector" of society, distinct from government and business, and including the family and the private sphere. By other authors, civil society is used in the sense of 

\begin{enumerate}
\item the aggregate of non-governmental organizations and institutions that manifest interests and will of citizens or 
\item individuals and organizations in a society which are independent of the government.
\end{enumerate}

Sometimes the term civil society is used in the more general sense of "the elements such as freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, etc, that make up a democratic society" (Collins English Dictionary). Especially in the discussions among thinkers of Eastern and Central Europe, civil society is seen also as a normative concept of civic values.

The literature on relations between civil society and democratic political society have their roots in classical liberal writings of G.W.F. Hegel from whom they were adapted by Alexis de Tocqueville, Karl Marx, and Ferdinand TÃ¶nnies. They were developed in significant ways by 20th century researchers Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba, who identified the role of political culture in a democratic order as vital.

They argued that the political element of political organizations facilitates better awareness and a more informed citizenry, who make better voting choices, participate in politics, and hold government more accountable as a result. The statutes of these political organizations have been considered micro-constitutions because they accustom participants to the formalities of democratic decision making.

More recently, Robert D. Putnam, an American political scientist, has argued that even non-political organizations in civil society are vital for democracy. This is because they build social capital, trust and shared values, which are transferred into the political sphere and help to hold society together, facilitating an understanding of the interconnectedness of society and interests within it.

Others, however, have questioned the link between civil society and robust democracy. Some have noted that the civil society actors have now obtained a remarkable amount of political power without anyone directly electing or appointing them. It has been argued that civil society aided the Nazi Party in coming to power in 1930s Germany. It has also been argued that civil society is biased towards the global north. Partha Chatterjee has argued that, in most of the world, "civil society is demographically limited." Finally, other scholars have argued that, since the concept of civil society is closely related to democracy and representation, it should in turn be linked with ideas of nationality and nationalism. Latest analyses suggest that civil society is a neoliberal ideology legitimizing antidemocratic attacks of economic elites on institutions of the welfare state through the development of the third sector as its substitute.

Civil society include among others, following institutions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Academia
\item Activist groups
\item Charities
\item Clubs (Sports, social, etc.)
\item Community foundations
\item Community organizations
\item Consumer organizations
\item Cooperatives
\item Foundations
\item Non-governmental organizations
\item Non-profit organizations
\item Private voluntary organizations
\item Professional associations
\item Religious organizations
\item Social enterprises
\item Social movement organizations
\item Support groups
\item Trade unions
\item Volunatary associations
\end{enumerate}

About PEFA: Historical Overview

PEFA began in 2001 as a means to harmonize country level assessment of public financial management (PFM) across the organizations that established the program. Those organizations were the European Commission, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and the governments of France, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. They remain the custodians of the program and have supported PEFA through four phases of implementation.

PEFA was established as a means to reduce the duplication and costs of multiple assessments and to facilitate dialogue between government and others about how to improve the effectiveness of fiscal policies. PEFA was also aimed at improving the results of development cooperation as part of the global aid effectiveness agenda. It provided support for the Strengthening Approach established in 2005 through the Paris Declaration, then further developed in the Accra Agenda for Action in 2008, and the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation in 2011.

Effective institutions and systems of public financial management (PFM) play a crucial role in the implementation of national policies concerning development and poverty reduction. Good PFM is the linchpin that ties together available resources, delivery of services, and achievement of government policy objectives. If it is done well, PFM ensures that revenue is collected efficiently and used appropriately and sustainably.

PEFA introduced a standard methodology and reference tool for PFM diagnostic assessments. It was extensively discussed and tested between 2001 and 2005 with the aim of harmonizing the needs of government and their development partners for a common analytical tool and shared data. The first publicly available version of PEFA was launched in 2005 and reports for Afghanistan and Zambia were produced in that year. 

Since the early assessments in 2005 PEFA has been used more than 500 times in 150 countries. It has become the acknowledged standard for PFM assessments and has amassed a pool of data comprising over 40,000 individual performance scores.

PEFA Program Phases

To date there have been four phases of the PEFA program. The current phase began in July 2012.

Phase I (2002-2005): Development
Phase II (2006-2008): Dissemination
Phase 1II (2009-2012): Integration
Phase IV (2012-2017): Global Public Good
