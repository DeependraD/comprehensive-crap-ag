## Collaborative efforts of Province 3 for Agricultural Development

Every year, import of agricultural commodities is witnessing the rise. While we have been stipulating Nepal as agricultural country, it is unfortunate/unwitting to know that we have been growing in not the productivity but in dependency in the sector upon the foreign. Almost two thirds of the national population is engaged in agricultural activities. Despite that, domestic production do not offer indications of self sustaining supply system anytime soon.

Government of Province 3, wherein majority households are still engaged in agriculture, has recently made efforts in planning the collaborative activities for the development of the sector. Keeping in view the intent to establish a self reliant the province in crop and livestock based commodities, the government has prepared and formulated different guidelines, constituting a total of 46, for the fiscal year 2077/78. The government has set forth on an ambitious vision of creating self sustainance in meat, fish, egg, milk, fruits, vegetables, flower, honey and mushroom within the time span of three years and cereal within the upcoming five years. Several projects are being launched in collaboration with private and cooperative sectors for cereal, milk and fish/meat production recently. This endevour is a recognition of the persisting situation that government operated projects and industries are largely unable to deliver on production objectives in the long run.

Provincial Directorate of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries of the Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperative has been calling for proposals from concerned firms and individuals for implementation of the different programmes. The directorate has specifically prioritized rearing of calves in Chitwan, Makawanpur and Sindhupalchowk, pooled rearing of cattle in Dolakha, establishment of livestock feed industry in Chitwan and Kavrepalanchowk districts. The directorate also called for the proposal on integrated rainbow trout farming and expansion in 16 location of the 8 districts of Province, collaboratively. Likewise, The Ministry is accepting proposals from interested individuals and firms for pig farming development and expansion program in Chitwan, Makawanpur and Sindhuli districts, and conduction of Chauri source stock development programme in Kalinchowk rural municipality and Bhimeshwor municipality of Dolakha district.

Six locations of Chitwan, Sindhupalchowk, Ramechhap and Dhading districts have already been proposed for collaboration in implementation of Intensive Goat Research, Extension and Development program. The province also has planned to avail support to fish rearing and fish based feed industry promotion. Current fiscal year budget of Rs 4.93 arab granted to the ministry will support establishment of model agricultural firm in each electorate of the province, incentivize milk production by offering Rs 1 subsidy in each liter of milk, establish industry for agricultural equipment and toolkit manufacturing and invest in supermarket complex and vegetable and fruits wholesale unit establishment.

This is a high time in order to shift focus to development of commercial infrastructures for overall agricultural development. For a substantive progress in agriulture sector, all three levels of the government should prioritize, while investing thoughtfully implementing with great care, efficient and productive utilization of the alloted budget to the sector. That way, the government could live upto the aspirations of the farming community and could play a instrumental role in ensuring the realization of the projected self sustainence vision within a few years period. Essentially, the collaborative conceptualization in agricultural development of the Province 3 will not only achieve economic development of the region itself but also provide an impetus for the movement of "Prosperous Nepal".
